Summary of Wake Up, Girls! Mantan Web interviews with Mayu and Airi. I wasn't planning to publish this here due to how I handled it (took out the interstitial portions and focused on responses) and it's a short interview-ish article but I feel the answers are worth sharing.  

Part 1 ([https://mantan-web.jp/article/20190225dog00m200031000c.html](https://mantan-web.jp/article/20190225dog00m200031000c.html))

**\-- When asked about their impression about WUG's history**  
  
Airi: We learned something new every day. We've gotten this far thanks to each other and I don't think there's a unit quite like ours. We each have disparate personalities and we don't always gel together but we work it out and we're very motivated to see things through.  
  
_The interviewer then pointed out that they didn't get along well at first._  
  
Airi: It is difficult when you're told to get along just like that. A lot of things happened but it's because of that we've become close. They're like family to me. I feel like myself when I'm with them. I don't think I'd feel this way if we simply got along easily.  
  
_Mayu was asked the same question regarding WUG history since she started during high school and she summarized her answer as "Youth"_  
  
Mayu: My time in college was largely dominated by WUG. Working with them is like doing a cultural festival. Planning with them is fun, and I can smile naturally once it's showtime. It's strange. I see them as more than just friends. I also see them as rivals, always pushing each other to greater heights.  
  
**\-- About hardships during their training camps**  
  
Mayu: No one wanted to work together at all.  
  
Airi: We were a mess and we had conflicts. It made me worry how we would be as it went on  
  
_When asked what the turning point was, Mayu said "It just sort of happened"_  
  
Mayu: I think our good points just started bubbling onto the surface as time went on and we slowly started to realize that in each other.  
  
Airi: We weren't close then so we never discussed anything. Sometimes we even argued. Those were tough times. We didn't have our sights to the future and we were very uncertain whenever we did live shows. Now though, we channel that uncertainty into enjoyment and just knowing that our fans are there with us gives us peace of mind.

\[Note: The way they talked about it in other interviews, they've only gotten along completely as friends and became comfortable as a group around 2016 and by 2017 did it seem like they were confident about their prospects in the future\]

**\-- When asked about their feelings toward Sendai after they disband**  
  
Airi: There are still things I wanted to do but I'm grateful for the many activities we've done over the years for Sendai and Tohoku. I'm very glad that there are now fans out there who consider Sendai their second home and I'm also grateful for the featured shops and places who have given them a warm reception.  

_When asked the same question, Mayu, an Osaka native, expressed her desire to "come back home to Sendai."_

Mayu:  Our fans are very passionate. I want to go back there again even more so than my actual hometown.

Airi: It's important to keep up the revitalization efforts, in whatever form and however small it may be. Even if we're disbanded, our songs and characters live on.

**\--When asked about SSA being a very large venue for Final Live  
**  
Airi:  It certainly is huge but we still want our fans to see us perform as if we're right in front of them. For the setlist, we made sure that we'll be on stage for as long as possible and we want it to feel like a culmination of our 6 years of history.  
  
Mayu: That is our aim but most of all, we want to end it with a smile. There will be tears but I feel it's been our way to end things that way. Working with WUG and the closeness we share is like organizing a culture festival every day and once Final Live wraps up, it will almost feel like the end of a festival.  
  
**\-- When asked about their activities after they disband,**  
  
Mayu: We each have our solo careers so we'd be scattered.  
  
Airi: We realized our own strengths and weaknesses through our activities so I'm excited to see what's in store in the future. It broadened my horizons so I'm motivated to try many different things, challenge myself, and get myself out there. Make a genre all to my own. 

\[Note: Airi's sentiment of "My own genre" is something she started mentioning since the disband announcement.\]  

Mayu: Both of us want to do everything. Be someone that can do anything. Because of WUG, I was able to write scripts and do other things other than just acting. It's because of those experiences that I'm here now.  
  
Airi: I learned a lot of thing because of our activities and I've matured a lot mentally. I am who I am right now because of those experiences. Right now though I feel more anxious than ever, wondering what I'd do next once I'm on my own. But I'm excited all the same since it's a new step.  
  
Mayu: We gained a lot of skills through our activities and we'll still rely on and discuss things with each other whatever happens.  
  
**\-- When asked if WUG didn't happen**  
  
Airi: I can't even imagine what my life would have been if it weren't for WUG.  
  
Mayu: I might not have gone to Tokyo. I would have studied college and found a job in Kansai and probably not have pursued acting as a profession. Maybe I would have in Osaka as a secret hobby or something.  
  
Airi: I would have been pursuing graduate studies at this point. I love Philosophy and I might have become a teacher... maybe. It's a strange thought.  
  
**\-- Interviewer mentioned that a lot of fans want them to be reformed**  
  
Mayu: Maybe after 10 years... If we still keep in touch and in good terms. It might be possible.  
  
Airi: 10 years? We'd be kinda old by then.  
  
Mayu: Or some of us might be mothers by then!?
