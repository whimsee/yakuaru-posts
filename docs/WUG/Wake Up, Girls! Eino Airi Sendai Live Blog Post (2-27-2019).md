This is a little out-of-order but as an extra I decided to publish here some of the translated blog posts the members wrote after their final tour stop in Sendai that I originally posted in the [WUG Discord](https://discord.gg/eQz3fjm). SSA Final Live might be their final show but they always considered their Sendai stop to be their final live so I feel it's just as important to get out there their thoughts about it and their sentiments about the then-approaching Final Live and disbandment.

Spring is coming! It’s slowly getting warmer and every day I keep hoping that would be the time I get to wear the clothes I prepared for spring so I can get that nice warm feeling inside!

Not only that, I finally get to use my Sakura-themed tumbler! 〜ฅ(๑•̀ω•́๑)ฅ But for now, I keep it out just so I can see it. lol. Even just looking at it makes me happy and motivated because it’s so cute! 〜♡

Oh yeah! Lately, I found my favorite custom blend in Starbucks! I usually take my coffee black but I crave for something sweet every once in a while. It’s Starbucks latte with almond syrup, cream, and cinnamon. I urge you all to try it, especially if you like sweet drinks. And don’t forget to add cinnamon, I’m sure you’ll like it!

Last Saturday, we had our Sendai show for the WUG Tour! Thank you so much for those who came!!!

We did four shows in two days but it felt like it all went by in a flash. (´•̥ ω •̥\` ) But every show was so memorable and it’s because of everyone who came! It was wonderful and there were so many cheers and smiles that even now it’s still fresh on my mind. Thank you so much!!!

I handled the planned segment. To be honest, I worried a lot about what to do. Every day I kept doubting myself and revised my plans because it’s Sendai, my beloved hometown, WUG’s sacred ground. It’s very important to us.

In the midst of my anxiety, I decided to walk around Sendai when I went there during New Year’s. I got inspired as I took in the atmosphere and decided to show my appreciation in the only way I can, as honest and as earnest as I can manage.

Since it’s a live show, I decided to start things off strong with dance corner!

\[She danced _U.S.A._ by DA PUMP for afternoon and _overture_ from the anime with her own choreography\]

Thank you for enjoying it! I really poured my soul into them. It actually feels strange as well because I got to dance solo in Sendai Sunplaza, a place I’m quite familiar with.

I started learning dance in earnest in Sendai when I was in 4th grade. I dabbled in a lot of stuff but the longest I’ve stuck with is dance since I’ve been doing it for about 9 years. Back then, I wouldn’t have imagined I would perform on a stage like that and it wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for my Mom, who pushed me to try dancing.

When I was on that stage, I kept thinking of how serendipitous life can be. Thank you, Mom! Also, the song I performed to at the time was a Morning Musume song and I danced my heart out. Good job, 3rd grade me!

That’s why I’m very grateful for WUG that I get to stand on this stage and it goes without saying that it was so fun dancing there!!!!

I also wanted to perform the songs where I designed the choreography so we did. We performed _Tightrope Runaway_ and _outlander rhapsody_, then I sang _minority emotions_.

I’m sure some people have wondered why I included minority emotions in a dance corner, especially right before _Heartline_. There’s actually a lot of meaning to it but to keep things simple, it’s an expression of my time in WUG as if it’s the passing of the seasons. If you’re still curious, try to dig deeper to it. You’ll probably find it interesting.

And to cap off the segment, I sang _Sakura Crescendo_. All my solo songs hold a special place in my heart and I sang them thanking the people of Sendai for helping me grow and it is truly because of them that I get to be on stage.

However, I also wanted to do something more practical so I prepared a video message. Thank you for helping out in the middle of your busy schedules!!!

I couldn’t hold back my tears when I first watched the finished video. It had people who’ve always been there for us. Everyone that had always been warm and welcoming. Who always supported us with their smiles. It’s because of them we’ve gotten this far and no amount of gratitude is enough.

Also, thank you so much to the countless WUGners who came all the way to Sendai. I still want to continue doing activities to revitalize Sendai and Tohoku so I look forward to your continued support!!

Thank you so much, Sendai, for the full bloom of the Sakura trees!!! It was a sight to behold. _✲ﾟ_( _´﹀\` )_✲ﾟ\*

Also, I get to be the princess on the second day. _✲ﾟ_( _´﹀\` )_✲ﾟ\*

What do you think? I think that’s the first time in my life I did a love confession… It really is embarrassing to say those words. lol. But I did it anyway to make everyone happy so I hope it worked!!! (∩´͈ ᐜ \`͈∩)♡

The shows really just flew by…. Thank you so much for attending!!! It was so fun being with you all I almost didn’t want to leave.

Thank you for the flowers and letters. I received so many. Thank you so much!!

\[Just an aside since “letters”. Out of everyone, Airi regularly and consistently thanks in the blog everyone who sends her letters. She always writes that it keeps her spirits up, that she reads and re-reads it whenever she feels down and responds to some of the questions in the blog or asks for recommendations when she’s looking for something to watch.\]

And with that, our 33-show HOME Tour has come to a close, fortunately without any incident!!! Thank you so much for giving your time to us. I’m so glad that I was able to meet our fans. This wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for WUG so I see it as a miracle. An encounter unlike any other. Thank you for making me happy. The time I’ve spent with you all is the best, and nothing will ever replace that. Thank you for the wonderful smiles you always give us.

It’s also a miracle that I auditioned for WUG and I got to meet the girls. I cannot imagine working with anyone else. This tour made me realize once again how great we are. That’s there’s no other unit that stands out like us. This might sound arrogant coming from me but this tour shows that we are the best.

Next is SSA, the final show to end all the smiles and tears. Let’s make it a great one and we’ll be sure to make it a day that will leave a mark in history.

Once again, thank you for coming to the tour!!!

\[Then she segues to going to Animate and Gamers Sendai to thank the people there the day before the live. They featured WUG in their stores and even exhibited their signed stuff. She also left a signed message so check that out.  
  
She also wrote going out to eat with their managers at the recommended places. And she ended the blog by thanking those who watched Patto UP!\]

We wore these for our shows. +.ﾟ(\*´□\`\*)ﾟ.+:  
They're both cute and wearing them in Sendai bring out the significance it has. I'm glad I got to wear the TUNAGO outfit there again.  
  
Good night ଘ(੭ˊ꒳​ˋ)੭✧
