Good evening, everyone! Eino Airi here!  ٩(◦\`꒳´◦)۶  

It's Saturday. March 9. How was your morning, everyone? It should have been a normal everyday morning for me but somehow something doesn't feel right in the world. It feels as if a gaping hole opened up in my heart. That's how my morning went and it feels very strange.  

That being said, just like every day, I started my morning with a cup of coffee! That's what I did today while relaxing to Sakura Crescendo. Going over my usual routine puts me at ease. Hopefully a pleasant morning greets you, too!  

Thank you everyone for always supporting us and reading the blog.

If you've only known about us yesterday and are now reading this blog, thank you as well.

I'm writing this post hoping that my feelings will somehow reach you.  

Some of these were taken from the letter everyone heard yesterday so without further ado...  

Yesterday was our final live show.

It was held at the Saitama Super Arena. Who would have thought we'd ever do a solo live there? Who would in their wildest dreams imagine the seven of us standing on that stage? No one would have predicted that future when we began but it happened. When I think about it, our 6 years as WUG feels just as long as it is short. There were sufferings and hardships and also moments of sadness and pain.  

We had harsh training camps where we ran every morning and struggled in our lessons. Back then, we weren't united and it seemed everyone was fighting a battle on their own. It may have been our most painful time. But now our bonds are so strong that we share everything equally. Our joys and laughter, and also our pains. It's because of this bond that we've given our all and gotten this far.  

It may have been pure chance that brought us together. But if I think about it, I believe it was meant to be. We wouldn't have met each other if we hadn't known about the audition or if any of us hadn't decided to audition.

I am very grateful that WUG is the seven of us. We wouldn't be WUG if one of us were missing and I believe that with all my heart. It's hard to put into simple terms our journey from start of finish and how it ended with all of us smiling. Our personalities are so far apart from each other and different from our respective characters. Our strengths and weaknesses are also different. Same goes for our food preferences. But even so, we complement each other and I believe we're one-of-a-kind. I really enjoyed the times we performed in our shows as well as the times where we just chatted. I might be the only one who believes this but the imbalance we had is what makes us perfectly balanced. From the coolness we project in our live shows, to the funny things we do in variety shows. I love all of it. That's what made us great! Thank you, girls!

Also, to all our fans. Thank you so much for being my source of strength. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have pushed myself as hard as I could. No amount of thanks is enough. I'm sure you also have your own hardships but you're always there to make me smile. You're always there with your letters that you send despite your busy lives. I may not be able to receive them in that manner anymore but I'll always be happy for the fact that you've sent me so many heartfelt letters. Thank you so much. I'll treasure them. Thank you so much for appreciating what we do.  

As long as you keep that fire burning in your hearts, WUG will keep on living. It doesn't have to happen now. Maybe it will take five, ten, even twenty years. Just like art and music, people will look back and realize how great we were.

The curtain closes on my time as WUG but our songs and our history will live on. Let our songs resound in someone's heart so it continues even further.  

To our managers. Make up artists. Stylists. Choreographers. Management staff. People we worked with. Our families. Everyone involved in WUG. Thank you so much for taking care of us. We've have gotten this far because of you. We wouldn't have been on that magnificent stage without you. I have nothing but gratitude. Our smiles continued to shine because you're always there to help. Thank you for showering us with love!  

I kept going on about serious stuff but that's how I've always been, right? lol Sorry that you had to read though another long post right at the end. But this is what I truly feel right at this very moment.  

If you've only known about us through yesterday's show, have only gotten interested in us recently, or went to the show because we're ending, it's never too late!!! From here on, I want more people to know about WUG!!! We're an interesting bunch!!! lol  

I have to say.... It was so much fun in SSA!!!

Being on a stage that grand... happily sharing the moment with so many people... It felt like a dream but it wasn't!!! It was real, wow! I feel pretty sad too since it's our final day but it's overshadowed by how fun it all was that it felt like it was over in an instant. Thank you, thank you for showing us that view. Each and every one of those lights pointed toward us warmed my heart so much. I'm happy we got to spend that time with everyone. Thank you so much! I will never forget that view, that time, that atmosphere for as long as I live!!! It will be my most precious treasure. Thank you! Thank you!  

The show was recorded (It's coming out on June 28! Yeah!), but the memories of that day should live on in my heart.  

Thank you for overwhelming amount of flowers!!!

We're all opening our own doors starting today! To quote Yoppi, our second chapter just started! WUG the unit just ended but brand new paths are open for each of us to tread.  

It goes without saying that I'll keep on keeping on!!! I, Eino Airi, will not stop moving forward and I'll make you proud that you supported me!!! I want to breathe more life into my beloved Tohoku and Sendai. There's so many things I've yet to accomplish and I won't leave them as ideas. I'll make them happen. So that everyone will come to appreciate Tohoku. So that everyone will want to visit Tohoku. I'll do everything in my power.  

And as a performer, there's so many roles I want to do. I want to make everyone smile when I talk. I could be about my interests, or baseball, things that I love. I want to spread my appreciation for them. I want to try so many new things. I want to write a song that people will hear. I want to hold an event so I can see everyone again.  

At the moment, these are only hopes, wishes, and dreams. But they will come true. There's so much I want to keep close so I just have to make them happen. Because I believe that everything in my life has a purpose, that everything happens for a reason, that everything is connected.  

Spring is coming, the season where my beloved sakura trees will be blooming. It might sound like I'm stating a given fact but it's not. They bloom so they can bestow upon us their beauty and happiness. Every year, there are beautiful sakura trees that fully blossom. It's a very difficult task to grow them from a seed, but with love they will bloom beautiful flowers. But there is beauty present in those that haven't completely bloomed and I aim to become a person like that.  

\[Note: This is Airi's signature speech that she's written and spoken in some form or another since March's anniversary live and why it's "Like a Sakura"\]  

Everyone, thank you so much for supporting WUG!!! I hope you keep supporting us and me, Eino Airi, in the future!!!  

\[Airi\] Oh, Hayashida Airi, I'm not saying goodbye to you since you'll still be around and we'll be working together. (∩´͈ ᐜ \`͈∩)

\[Hayashida Airi (Aichan)\] You don't sound grateful enough! lol

\[Airi\] But I'm always grateful to you.... Let's be together forever. ☆

\[Aichan\] There's a lot we've yet to do so let's do it!!!

\[Airi\] I'm glad you're always there for me.

\[Aichan\] There's still so much we can do for Tohoku!

\[Airi\] I look forward to working with you again, Aichan!  

We won't be seeing each other through this blog anymore but I'll figure something out!!! So before then, why don't you stick around? lol  

Just you wait! I promise! Until next time!
