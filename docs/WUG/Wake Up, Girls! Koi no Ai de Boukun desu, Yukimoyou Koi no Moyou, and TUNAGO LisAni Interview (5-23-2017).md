**\-- How would you describe** _**Koi? de Ai? de Boukun desu!**_**?**  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-009.jpg)

Aoyama Yoshino (Aoyama): It’s a song filled with new ideas for us as a group. We haven't done one that had a cute pop melody since our songs are mostly somber and grandiose. So our singing took on a more cutesy approach and it's our first time working with [Hata Aki](https://vgmdb.net/artist/413) as the lyricist. But even so, it’s a song that stays true to our identity as a group.  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-004.jpg)

Okuno Kaya (Okuno): When I first heard the song, it had a "This is an anisong (anime song)" impression to it, which is completely different from our songs thus far that more to our style. I always wanted to do a song like this so I really enjoyed singing it. Even the dance choreography is challenging.

Tanaka Minami (Tanaka): This song got me to discover a whole new side to our group. It has numerous solo parts that bring out our individual voices that mesh into a fun combination once we all sing together.  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-007.jpg)

Takagi Miyu (Takagi): I think this song is catchy enough to get the attention of people who don't know about us, but it will also show a new side to those who do know us with how differently we sing our solo portions. Especially, Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino), who is using her voice as Guri \[The protagonist of Love Tyrant\]. It really sounds unlike her and I’m excited for everyone to hear it.  

**\-- You did that?**  

Aoyama: Yeah. Since the song will be the main theme for _Love Tyrant_ (_Renai Boukun_), I attempted to go for a 50-50 split between my voice and Guri's but after some trial and error, Guri ended up taking 80 percent...  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**\-- (laughs) I can sense from the lyrics and the title that it has Hata-san's unique flavor to it.**  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-008.jpg)

Yamashita Nanami (Yamashita): The bridge is pretty great.  

Takagi: I agree.  

Yamashita: ♪_Baby baby kara darling ni nacchaunda_ ♪ (laughs)  

Tanaka: Who comes up with those lyrics? (laughs) But she’s a genius. those lines are perfect for _Love Tyrant_.  

**\-- Not only that, MONACA's Tanaka-san (Tanaka Hidekazu) composed and arranged it and he brought out the rhythmical pop side of WUG**.  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-005.jpg)

Yoshioka Mayu (Yoshioka): While Hata-san brought WUG out of its comfort zone with the lyrics, Tanaka-san, who we’ve worked with since the start, anchored the song back to its roots, making a perfect balance of both.  

Yamashita: The arrangement is frantic, a perfect fit to _Love Tyrant_'s vibe. Tanaka-san even included clapping sounds, which are actually our claps being recorded, so don’t miss them.  

**\-- I think that fresh vibe also extends to the music video. Especially the black outfits that incorporates Guri’s cape. It has a devious vibe to it.**  

Yoshioka: This is our first time dancing with heels so our movements ended up becoming are very dainty and bouncy. (laughs) But it's something different that shows a new side of WUG and it feels fresh to me every time I dance it.  

**\-- But isn't it hard getting the moves right on top of the complicated formations?**  

Takagi: It really is!  

![](/images/1705231900-YH-003.jpg)

Eino Airi (Eino): Especially this one where we had the least amount of time to memorize it all. We only had a day of practice to get it perfect the next day.  

Yoshioka: And we had to do the shoot the day after that... oh wait, we showed it live for the first time before that!  

Okuno: It all happened in a week.  

Yamashita: It's a fast song and the formation changes were frantic so we put a lot of focus on that during our practice.  

Eino: It takes in the mood of _Love Tyrant_ and even has Guri's pose in it. With those aspects, I'm sure those who love _Love Tyrant_ will enjoy the choreography.

Koi de Ai de Boukun desu short version MV  
Sidenote: This video reached 1M views in such a short time that they ended up commenting on it.

\-**\- What's your favorite part of the music video?**  

Eino: I like the second part of the first verse where it goes "_saishuuheiki desu_" \[ultimate weapon\] and we all pose as if we're holding different weapons. We all put our heads together to think of ideas so keep an eye on it.  

Aoyama: I did a bow and arrow pose in the music video but I can't do that in a live show since it requires the use of both hands... so I job-changed to using guns.

\[Another thing they stopped doing during a live show are the cartwheels in 7 Girls War once they started using hand mics.\]

_(everyone laughs)_  

**\-- (laughs) I did notice that. I also noticed the dance sequences that were cut in parallel to the story portions. It seems to tell a story of you girls doing battle while waiting for someone, which seems in line with the romantic comedy themes of _Love Tyrant_.**  

Okuno: Each of us faced off with someone else and mine was Minami. I chased after her with a nunchuck but all she did was a kung-fu pose and I was no match against her.  (laughs)  

Tanaka: We also drove around in Go-Karts.  

Okuno: That was my first time driving one. I was the one chasing and you can accelerate really quickly in those so immediately floored it once we started. (laughs)  

Tanaka: She suddenly bumped into me and I thought, "Whoa! Kaya's so reckless!" (laughs) So I took it seriously and floored it too, then I heard another bump and when I looked back to check, it was Kaya crashed on the curve. (laughs) We immediately needed to get off after that.  

\[Minami is the only one with a driving license which she got in 2014\]  

Okuno: Yeah, it just stopped moving. But the face I had made for a good shot.  

**\-- Sounds like both of you got a little too carried away. (laughs)**  

Okuno: I'm not good at turning. When I try to turn the handle to the left, somehow it goes the other way. I mean, I don't have a driving license after all. (laughs)  

**\-- (laughs) At least no one got hurt and that enthusiastic performance was still captured in the music video. I want to ask about the B-side song that came with the CD,** _**Yukimoyou Koi no Moyou**_ **from the** _**Wake Up, Girls! Aoba no Kiroku**_ **stage play. How was it performed there?**  

Yoshioka: The stage play is based on _Wake Up, Girls! Seven Idols_ (_Shichinin no Idol_) and it's from a scene that was not depicted in the movie of the girls deepening their friendship. It's a cover of a song originally sung by the fictional 2-person unit _Twinkle_, which the girls used as a practice piece. It has a somber and mature vibe, and it's about girls in a difficult age, bonding together and discovering love for the first time. It was used in the stage play to relate to the girls' deepening friendship, which makes for a perfect B-side for the CD.  

**\-- Tadano Natsumi's lyrical writing style about youth shines here with the help of MONACA's Hirokawa Keiichi's arrangement. It brings up images of winter and your combined voices have an overwhelmingly clear sound.**  

Okuno: We recorded it during our rehearsal period for the stage play. It was our first stage play so we were feeling nervous but we all wanted to make it great. I think we used that feeling to connect with the song and why it sounded very gentle and soothing.  

\[While they did mention in numerous places how Aoba no Kiroku was their first stage play, Mayu, Miyu, Yoppi did have previous professional theater experience through SOLID STAR Produce’s shows (mostly double or even triple cast roles at the time), and Minami did theater during high school.  
  
Miyu would write how Mayu helped her memorize lines, asking her for pointers each session, while Airi (who had no experience but almost had the most lines in the show), often practiced with Mayu early before everyone else came in.  
  
This experience resonated with them, especially Airi and Kaya, who cited that time as one of her inspirations for her change in 2017. Both eventually started branching off to do stage plays, often with people they previously worked with in WUG stage shows.\]

Tanaka: The approach for the chorus was different this time. Each member did different parts. It was difficult but we really wanted to show that side of us and I was so moved when I heard the finished version it that I got goosebumps. I urge everyone to give it a listen.  

**\-- How did the audience react when you performed it during the stage play?**  

Yamashita: I think a lot of people were in tears.  

Tanaka: We’ve yet to perform it anywhere else so I imagine only a few people would have heard it. It's also an unbearably cute song and very “us” and I hope we were able to convey the same feelings in CD version.

TUNAGO Short Version MV

**\-- There’s also another song, TUNAGO, which was written by Tadano-san and composed and arranged by Hirokawa-san. It gives off a grand dramatic vibe with the lyrics talking about “Hometown”. How did you approach this song?**  

Yamashita: The direction was to think of our hometown as we sing it so we did it gently. While it is a song written about Tohoku, each of us has their respective hometown, such as me which is Tokushima.  

**\-- Since it is being used as AEON Tohoku's** _**Nigiwai Tohoku**_ **\[a revitalization project\] image song, I would like to ask Eino-san and Okuno-san about their thoughts, being from Miyagi and Iwate, respectively.**  

Okuno: We first showcased the song during a charity event that we held in Iwate. It was our first time doing a WUG event there and I was really glad since I always hoped it would happen and it finally did in our 4th year. Since it's a song meant to soothe and comfort people, it completely resonated with me.  

\[Kaya mentioned in her introduction in _All Night Nippon Mobile_ how she eventually settled into calling Morioka her hometown primarily because she spent the most time there when she was a kid when their family moved from place to place. She also considers Tokyo her second hometown.\]  

Eino: The song is gentle and flowing and the lyrics have an optimistic tone to it. While we’ve done activities in Sendai since that’s where the anime is set, we don’t get a lot of chances to show that support in other ways due to our activities in Tokyo. So I sing the song, hoping to convey feelings of support and camaraderie to Tohoku and give it an encouraging push, even just a little.  

**\-- So while it has a theme of “hometown”, another theme, that of “bonds”, also come into mind. Which part of the song speaks to you the most?**  

Yoshioka: You'll get the meaning once you see it but it incorporates pieces of choreography from our previous songs, giving this song something that represents the activities we've done so far as a whole. We're all lined up in a row as we sing our solo lines, which flow from one into the next, giving reference the title’s meaning, which is “To connect”. The word it is based on, _Tsunagu,_ carries a lot of meaning in the song—it connects the past to the future and connects us as we are now to each other.

TUNAGO Choreography video for 4th Live Tour

Eino: As the one who did the choreography, this is the song I struggled with the most. It's a gentle song so the movements have to reflect that while keeping it simple and expressive enough to convey everybody’s emotions. Just like the meaning of the line  “_Minna wo tsunagou_", I want the choreography to be something that our fans to join in and do.  

\[Airi also did the choreography for Chikatetsu Labyrinth, Tightrope Runaway, outlander rhapsody, Heartline, and Polaris.\]  

**\-- Now that you mentioned it, I want to ask which song the choreography is connected to.**  

Eino: The intermission of _Kotonoha Aoba_. The movements mime the transferring of the spirit from one member to another until it finally settles on Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu). But this time all of us make the same movements as we try to connect our stories with everyone. That's what we decided as the group and I hope those who see it also feels that desire to connect.  

**\-- I have to say that the songs in this single release bring out WUG’s unique charm in their own way. With the summer just around the corner and the tour and other events coming with it… I know you can’t talk about it yet but to close out this interview, can you say something about them.**  

Takagi: We challenged ourselves in many ways this year. We had a stage play, a tie-up collaboration, and it was just announced that we will be performing in _Animelo Summer Live 2017_. We want to show everyone the fruits of those efforts in the upcoming tour so that more people might become fans of us and watch the new anime \[_Wake Up, Girls! New Chapter_ (_Shin Shou_)\]... so I’m hoping for a great summer. (laughs)  

Aoyama:  We wanted to do more than just perform the opening theme to an anime, so we aim to go outside the box while staying true to our identity. We have other collaborations in store so don't miss it!  

Eino:  After our 3rd live tour wrapped up, we've done various new activities that were unrelated to the WUG anime, both in our solo careers and the group. I think we've done a good job spreading our name since then and I hope who’ve come to know us will come to the tour. We’ll make sure they will enjoy it. We have so many things planned this summer for the new anime and hopefully this tour encourages more people to watch it when it comes out.  

Okuno: Until now, we’ve been pushing ourselves further than before but only this year did I believe that we can turn those hopes into reality. Since April, we feel very motivated that we can aim even higher as we do more events so that more people will know about us.  

Yoshioka: I believe we are now able to respond to the expectations of those who go to our live shows and we hope to keep that going this year.  

Yamashita: We've gone through a lot in the past, but lately, I think we're finally able to tap into the potential we've been trying our hardest to reach, and we want to show that to everyone in the upcoming tour.  

Minami:  I see this tour as a chance for more people to get to know about us and the upcoming anime, so I want it to make a big splash. Like Nanami said, we’ve yet to show everyone our full potential!
