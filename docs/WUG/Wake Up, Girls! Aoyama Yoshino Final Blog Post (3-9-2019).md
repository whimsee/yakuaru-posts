OhaYoppi!

Aoyama Yoshino here.

How’s everyone doing?

I’m doing great.

I lied. 😔 I’m not doing well at all.

My legs hurt. My chest hurts. Everything hurts.

I feel like a carrot that’s completely frozen dry. 🥕

Normally, I write about my thoughts on Thursdays so getting to do it right after an event is making me really fired up. My fingers and my brain are busy working while the rest of my body’s taking it easy.

And to celebrate the first day of my second chapter... I took a break! I slept, woke up, had a meal, and took a stroll. The entire time though, it felt as if something was wrong. No matter what I did, it was like my heart was missing. It wasn’t just a hole. More like it was completely gone, lost itself to yesterday.

But anyway, let’s get right into it—my final summary.

_“WUG is the best!!!”_

That’s a fact.

We did our Final Live. We packed it with as many songs as we could while bringing in a lot of our ideas!

So how about I do a writeup of my personal highlights...

* * *

March 8. Friday. 6:30PM

It’s finally the day. Everything felt like usual between us girls but we started feeling more and more restless as time passed.  
  
President Tange, Matsuda-san, and Hayasaka-san kicked things off. After that, we heard our names being called through our earpieces signalling that the show had just begun.

**M1.** _Tachiagare!_  
Way to set the tone, Mayushi!  
SSA brought us all together as one!!!  
I almost cried.

**M2.** _16-Sai no Agape_ to the center stage!  
It was a delight getting to dance there on the walkway.  
And if you thought I was looking directly at you at the time, you bet I was. ◎

**M3.** _7 Girls War_  
Miyu was so adorable… I hope that got captured for the BD…  
Those uniforms and the way we sang really felt like going back to our roots. hehehe. ☺️

Next came the introductions.

It was so brilliant seeing SSA lit with our colors! 😭✨ 

**M4.** _Yukimoyou Koi no Moyou_  
We really wanted to sing this while wearing our uniforms.  
It brought me back to our stageplays—_Kiroku_ and _Kiseki_—both precious memories.

**M5.** _Kotonoha Aoba_  
We wanted to recreate the pageant of lights so we went over that arrangement with the stage personnel.

Next was,

**M6.** _One In A Billion_!   
A precious song that came about during our time as _Wake Up, May’n!_  
  
Apparently May’n-chan wasn’t on the reserved seats but was somewhere in the audience instead! 😭✨So we planned something for this performance.  
  
We love you with all our hearts, always and forever.

\[According to May’n tweets and her blog, she had been offered reserved seats but she wanted to have the “authentic WUGNER experience” so she applied for the lottery (and won), personally paid for the ticket (nervously) at a convenience store, tried to head to SSA to line up for merch after quickly finishing her work in the afternoon but stopped halfway and turned back, feeling dejected after learning that it completely sold out (she ended up buying them during the online sale).  
  
It was Yoppi suggested the surprise gesture of adding an extra spotlight on stage for May’n during OiaB’s opening especially when they realized the lengths she went through to experience their final show.\]

**M7.** _Sugao de KISS ME_  
The formation was an SSA exclusive!  
All the lasers and light shows were a feast for the eyes 😎😎✨  
And what followed that mature expression of love was...

**M8.** _Koi ? de Ai? de Boukun desu!_ ◎  
The final Boukun. Guri descended upon us all.  
Mihoshi-senpai’s flower stand illustration was lovely… Thank you. 😭✨

**M9.** Character song medley!  
I got to sing _Stella Drive_ in SSA, shout that we adore Kaya, and do “shan shan.” It was so fun…  
We also did an all-members version _Non stop diamond hope_! It was the best!

![](/images/o2364177414369166284.jpg)

**M10.** _WUG Zoo Zoo_  
🐣🐺🐯🦁🦈🐊🐻 Raising the energy even higher! It also dawned on me how massive SSA is when I realized exactly how far I was from the stage.

Then came the intermission and it was a collaboration video between _WUGChannel!_ and _Peraji_!!!

\[_Peraji_ is shorthand for their radio show, _Wake Up, Girls!Gambappe Radio_\]

And with that, the second gauntlet was underway.

**M11.** _HIGAWARI PRINCESS_ All-members version! ☺️☺️  
We all get to be the princess, which includes me of course. 💓

**M12.** _Suki no Skill_ | **M13.** _Bokura no Frontier_  
We did the exact same performance during the public rehearsal!  
There were mistakes that we fixed though… 💪 so I hope you noticed… lolol

**M14.** _7 Senses_ on carts!  
It was so much fun singing with all of you around us!  
This was the place we promised after all.

**M15.** _Gokujou Smile_!  
This kinda brought me back to Anisama.  
That and the fact that we’re singing this at SSA gave me a burst of energy ☀️

Following that was an intermission video that showed messages from colleagues who have helped us grow over the years.

I’m so touched that the I-1 Club members even organized their own flower stand for us… They’ve been nothing but great to us from the very beginning. They’re irreplaceable and no amount of thanks is enough to express our gratitude!

Thank you for everything.

Next was...

**M16.** _Shizuku no Kanmuri_.   
From here on, it felt as if the world suddenly took on a different tone.  
WUG isn’t always about the fun stuff after all.

**M17.** _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_ | **M18.** _Beyond the Bottom_  
Performing these songs on this stage was like staking my life, giving it everything I got, so that it reaches out as far as it can go… 

I felt overwhelmed for a bit then came the finale—our four new songs.

The story of _Wake Up, Girls_! woven together.  
Its beginning, progression, turning point, and conclusion.

**M19.** _Umi soshite Shutter-doori_  
We walked through the streets of our hometown of Tohoku.  
I watched Mayu and Airi on the overhead screen as they sang behind me.  
There I thought rehearsing had prepared me for it but my emotions came bursting out anyway.

**M20.** _Kotoba no Kesshou_   
This song built an atmosphere of its own.  
Our most difficult choreography coupled with evocative lighting, it’s a vessel playing its tune until the very end.  
Of the new songs, this was the one that everyone pitched in the most to make.  
You could even call it our artistic masterpiece. It’s awesome!

**M21.** _Doyoubi no Flight_  
I’d like to point out that Mayushii and I were harmonizing for this.  
They played out differently since each verse was a little different too, but that alone brought a lot of emotions into life.  
It’s a song that embodied WUG as it was at that moment with the lyrics putting into words the feelings we’ve been carrying.

**M22.** _Sayounara no Parade_  
A few words can’t describe how powerful this song is, and its choreography has tons of memories attached to it; our final positions even match the beginning of _Tachiagare_.  
It is the end of things as much as it is the beginning.

I exited the stage wracked with tears… But it’s not as if all I do is cry!

**M23.** _SHIFT_!!!  
Were you surprised? 💃💃✨

![](/images/o2364177414369166827.jpg)

I wonder if that key ever got found...

**M24.** _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_  
We ran proverbial carts around the prestigious subway! lol  
That rap was on fire!! 🔥  
Thank you.

Next was...

**M25.** _TUNAGO_  
The song that connects Tohoku, us, and the fans with each other.  
I saw how well you did the motions with us.  
And in doing so, it’ll keep us in touch with Tohoku that has been there for us all this time.

Then came the second encore.  
It was nearing the end and I struggled over what to say.  
_Should I say something and what should I say now that we’re here?_  
I wanted to wrap them all together into something that everyone could understand.  
Thoughts like that played in my mind.

In the end, I laid out my feelings as they were.

The girls’ messages were fantastic. Only _Wake Up, Girls!_ could have written that. It made me proud for being such a goofball leader that gets lost while jogging!! lol

Then came our finale...

**M26.** _Polaris_  
Words alone can’t do this justice.  
We wove everything we are into a song.

But let me say this at least!

Thank you for showing us that magnificent starscape.

Surprise third encore.  
_Tachiagare_ with everyone!  
We wanted to show how grateful we are to every single person out there. And normally it would be me taking the stage doing the last solo part but this final time we wanted it to be all of us together.

Then at last, the closing introductions.

At that moment, there was still so much I wanted to say; things I’ve forgotten to say in past shows. Instead, I seized the moment to look at the girls as much as I could... lol

I looked at everyone in the eye, taking in the entire day how the seven of us made up this group. I mustered the most brilliant smile I could.

_“This has been Wake Up, Girls!”_

It didn’t matter if we looked haggard, smiling, or broken in tears.

That was the mark that we left at SSA. That we were _Wake Up, Girls!_

That we ended our final concert beloved by so many people all over.

That we smiled our best and cried our hardest.

That no one else comes close to _Wake Up, Girls!_

What a wall of text!!!!!!!!

Sorry you had to read so much!!! I just couldn’t stop once I started… 😭

Well, after all, this is the last day of the blog.

It’s a weird sensation, like something between accomplishment and loss. I still feel like we’re gonna do rehearsals next week, or a show, or something that meant we could see you all again. That’s why I still feel that same sense of excitement even now as I write this post.

Mayushii, who is never away from her stories.  
Aichan, who is always ready and willing to talk about anime.  
Minyami, who rarely does selfies.  
Nanami, who is always there to follow after me since the start.  
Kayatan, who is short but profound.  
Miyu, who tries her hardest to wipe sleep off her eyes after every event.

You can always read back and see that for yourself. The blog ends today but it did well nurturing each of our individual personalities.

Oh, right. I haven’t had the right moment to say it until now but I’m graduating soon! The hakama I picked was light blue and I was dying to show it to you all.

There’s so much I wanted to say—announcements of all kinds, reactions to your thoughts, and words of gratitude for the constant stream of flowers and letters—but I guess I should try to wrap this up.  Like I said yesterday, if only things didn’t have to end.

You know, I’ve always been pretty straightforward right from the get-go, ready to leave things behind in favor of what’s in front of me, thinking that it was right and poetic. However, it’s just as important to love ourselves. To switch things up and remake ourselves into someone completely new.

That’s how my second chapter will be.

That’s the second chapter we’re aiming to make.

Ahh! We can’t just sit on our toes and mope forever!

It’s the second chapter after all!! 

To the WUG project that connected me with so many people.  
To the girls who were with me through thick and thin.  
To my friends and family for all the love and affection you’ve given.  
And finally to all our fans who have supported us all this time…

You have my gratitude and more.

I love you all for as long as I live

We’ll see each other again wearing our brightest smiles!

So until then, never forget.

Thank you for everything, Wake Up, Girls!

And with that, off I go!
