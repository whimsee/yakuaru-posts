**\-- How's work going for you lately?**  

Okuno Kaya (OK): I'm happy to say I've been getting more opportunities to voice both named and background roles for anime, mobile games, and applications.  

**\-- How different is it to work in those environments compared to Wake Up, Girls! projects?**  

OK: There's a different kind of tension present. Of course, WUG projects come with their own worries and anxieties, but all of us go through it together, which makes it feel much easier to deal with. But when you’re in an environment that you’re not used to, you just feel tense all the time. Like you just want to practice quietly during breaks.  

**\-- With the summer packed with events like the 2nd live tour and Animelo Summer Live, as well as the theatrical release of _Wake Up, Girls! Shadow of Youth_ (_Seishun no Kage)_****, how did the year go for you?**  

OK: It went by really quickly. Last summer, I was so busy with the Tour, Anisama, Hanayamata, and other projects that it was hard to keep track of everything. But it did settle down by the time fall and winter came so I was expecting the same thing to happen this year. But I was wrong. I'm just as busy now and might still be until the end of the year, unexpectedly so. (laughs)  

![sp-15112092000-01](/images/sp-15112092000-01.jpg)

**\--Speaking of which, which is harder for you right now? Your busy schedule or the fact that you have more weekly live shows this year compared from last?**  

OK: I'm not sure... This year has certainly been rougher on us performance-wise, but I think last year was harder on us physically. I think the better question is whether I can physically keep up with it.  

**\-- How’s your stamina?**  

OK: I’ve built it up somehow. Maybe there's something I'm doing right all this time but since summer I've been feeling pretty good about myself physically and I'm not sure why.  

\-**\- Can you tell me about _Machiasobi_?**  

OK: I went there as part of WUG and Hackadoll. It was my first time reaching the summit and the view was amazing. The sky was stretching out everywhere. I'm glad that I got a rare opportunity to work in that kind of natural setting. I went there with Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) and Airi (Eino Airi) and seeing them enjoying it really made the experience.  

**\-- How did your _Seiyuu Yume Nikki_ \[A variety video series where voice actors do different activities\] DVD meeting event go?**  

OK: Oh, yeah... The announcement for Tokushima was on such short notice that I was worried if anyone would come. A surprising amount of people did, which was a relief.  

**\-- How different was the experience compared to your other meeting events?**  

OK: There were a lot of familiar faces. (laughs) That said, Tokushima is a welcoming place so I felt closer interacting with the people there, who were quite friendly.

**\-- Speaking of regional events, can you tell us about your part in Nagoya for _I-1club VS Wake Up, Girls!_****?**  

OK: I was up against Yamamoto Nozomi-san who plays Suzuki Moka. We often get paired against each other such as in last year’s Fureai Project and Festa 2014 and I lost in both so I wanted to win this time. (laughs) I lost again because I’m not good at finger guessing games. If I were to describe I-1 with my hands, I’d end up making fox shapes…  

**\-- Your character, Kikuma Kaya, seems to be the type to get easily provoked. What was the mood during the match?**  

OK: Yamamoto-san was friendly and our quiz section actually ended in a tie. But when we reached the main event, she got focused and serious that I was no match for her. (laughs) I lost in the end, but she's such a good sport that she even wanted to throw the match for me. She told me it was because she wanted to see more of our activities… Then she apologized and proceeded to demolish me. (laughs)  

![sp-15112092000-05](/images/sp-15112092000-05.jpg)

**\--What did you and Yamamoto-san talk about during breaks?**  

OK: We happened to wear the same kind of necklace that day. It came from the same store, the only difference being mine had a cat motif while hers had a dog. She also had the cat version so we could have gotten a matching pair along with her cute clothes.  

**\-- Did you get to try Nagoya’s local specialties?**  

OK: I had Tenmusu (Onigiri with shrimp tempura filling) and Miso katsu! I was lucky to find a place nearby that offers it while I was waiting for the bullet train! Next time, I want to try Taiwan ramen.

**\-- Before we get to** **_Wake Up, Girls!_** **_Beyond the Bottom_****, can you tell me about Kikuma Kaya and the changes she went through leading up to the movie?**  

OK: Kikuma Kaya is the oldest member of the group and serves as the foil to Miyu's comic shenanigans. She's quite blunt but lately, she'd become more gentle and encouraging. She can be childish when once she starts feeling competitive, but she is essentially a mature and responsible person.  
  
If there's anything that changed in her, it's her outlook. At first, she just wanted to go wherever life took her but that changed when she decided to join WUG and she became more optimistic and ambitious as time went on.  

![sp-15112092000-07](/images/sp-15112092000-07.jpg)

**\-- What’s going through your mind right now with the release of** **_Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom_** **drawing near?**  

OK: There are many heartwarming scenes in this movie so I can’t wait for everyone to see it.  

**\--  What you mean by “heartwarming scenes”?**  

OK: I’m deeply interested in the scene between President Tange and Sapphire Reiko-san. I won't spoil what that is, so you just have to watch the movie to find out. (laughs) Her name first came up in _7 Idols (Shichinin no Idol)_ so it's a bit of a surprise to find out how she's related to her. I like her and I think her involvement makes for an interesting development in the story.  

**\-- How were the dubbing sessions? Were there any standout performances?**  

OK: Sapphire's voice actor, Sakuma Rei-san's performance stuck out for me. I was watching her and Hidaka Noriko-san (President Tange) and it was enlightening to see them work off each other. They were so good. I hope I can do that kind of performance someday, not to mention still be in the industry for as long as they have.  

**\-- I think they've known been good friends for about 20 or 30 years now. If you think about it, can you imagine yourself to be as close and still be working together with the other WUG members 20 years into the future?**  

![sp-15112092000-11](/images/sp-15112092000-11.jpg)

OK: I think it’s better to ask whether we'd still be around by then... (laughs) I hope it happens though. That would be great.  

**\-- Which scene involving Kaya stands out to you the most?**  

OK: I received letters from fans saying that they were moved by something Kaya-chan said in the teaser. It was "Do you have any regrets?". Out of context, it sounds grave and foreboding but I think I was able to emotionally convey it in a way that only Kaya-chan would.  

**\-- Did you know that people are saying that they're happy that Kaya-chan and Miyu-chan's gotten closer in _Shadow of Youth_?**  

OK: I feel the same way. Just like our characters, Myuu (Takagi Miyu), Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu) and I host a radio show, and we tend to gang up and tease Mayushii. I think we’ve gotten closer as a result of that and we make a good team. (laughs)  

\[Kaya and Miyu met each other for the first time while they were auditioning for the eventual role of Okamoto Miyu. According to Miyu, she was practicing her singing while waiting for her turn when Kaya approached her, complimenting her voice. As she was about to thank her, she was stunned by how beautiful Kaya was, calling her an "Angel", and was later surprised by their age difference. Since then, they were audition buddies until Kaya was moved to another group, which was for Kikuma Kaya. Before they separated, they wished each other luck and was happy to see each other again after all 7 members were decided.  
  
Other audition buddies: Mayu and Airi (more like their mothers) then later Minami for the eventual role of Shimada Mayu before they got separated to their respective roles. Nanami was pretty much locked into her group but she also made friends that she sometimes hung out with on her days off.\]

**\-- Speaking of which, Kaya-chan often dotes on Minami-chan. From your perspective, what do you think of her?**  

OK: Minami-chan is so adorable... She has a lot of scenes where she tears up and I just can't get enough of the look on her face that I want to see more of it. (laughs) I know she’s trying her best to say what she feels but when I see her like that I just can’t help myself.  

![sp-15112092000-02](/images/sp-15112092000-02.jpg)

**\-- Do you like seeing people cry?**  

OK: I like seeing little children cry. They look so cute!  

**\-- How about the other members? I'm sure you've seen them cry before.**  

OK: I feel like hugging (Tanaka) Minami when she's crying... then I start feeling like crying myself... She's just so adorable.  

**\-- Do you rate Minami-chan's crying face differently from Tanaka-san?**  

OK: They’re both special! Miyu as well. She makes quite a funny face when she cries. (laughs)  

**\-- In the sequel movies, which rival idol unit left an impression on you?**  

OK: Namahages! I’m so glad they’re back! They seem like scary people but their shows are so interesting. They’re also based in Akita prefecture, a place I’m fond of. As someone from Morioka, I had a lot of good memories going there with family, playing with dogs and crossing the bridge when I was little. In terms of characters, I liked how Shiho developed as a character so I’m rooting for her.  

\[In her self-introduction in _All Night Nippon Mobile_, she mentioned about her early childhood and how they constantly moved from place to place before eventually settling in Morioka, which is why she calls it her hometown, Tokyo she considers her second.\]

**\-- Let’s move on to the theme song, _Beyond the Bottom_****. It sounds quite different from your other songs.**  

OK: What stands out to me the most is the intro part where our voices flit in and out. It sounds mysterious and it wasn’t part of the rough track so I ended up listening to the final version so many times trying to imagine how our choreography was going to be, which wasn't something I usually do.  

![sp-15112092000-10](/images/sp-15112092000-10.jpg)

**\-- How did the recording sessions go?**  

OK: I was instructed to sing as myself, Okuno Kaya, instead of my character, Kikuma Kaya. That’s why my singing felt a little gentler than usual. That hasn’t happened since _Tachiagare_ so I was glad to have that opportunity again.

**\-- That’s true. Kikuma Kaya’s singing voice has a more commanding presence to it. Was it much easier to sing in your own voice?**  

OK: It’s hard to say. It feels more natural but I think it feels less impactful. Like it’s missing some weight. Kaya-chan’s voice is also easier to vibrato. However, I feel more comfortable listening to my own singing voice so I don’t know.  

**\-- What do you think about the melody?**  

OK: I think this song strongly represents who we are right now. It has an ephemeral feel to it. We just performed the entire song with choreography the other day. It’s a deliberately slower song, which contrasts with its ballet choreography, that’s why our movements need to be more polished than usual. The part I practiced a lot was after my line “_uchikudakare ima boku ha_” where I immediately duck right after because my voice usually breaks as I get winded out by the motion.

**\-- How about the music video? How did the shoot go?**  

OK: It was so cold that day! We did some shots on the beach near some elderly who were fishing. I had no idea they could do that there, much less if the fish were edible, so the thought stayed on my mind the entire time. (laughs)  

**\-- How about the rooftop scene? It looked like it was shot while the sun was setting until it was fully dark.**  

OK: We’ve never done a dance shoot like that before. It had gotten dark enough that they've had illuminated panels set up for us. And it was winter, so the air was clear. I remember being focused on practicing our steps up until the last minute. We were shooting the whole day and all of us were hungry at that point. Of course, we could take a few moments and eat but we insisted on practicing and polishing our steps, getting feedback, and such.  

**\-- What were your goals when you auditioned for WUG?**  

OK: I always wanted to become a voice actress so during the short lull period before I needed to look for a job, I decided to give it a final go and attended the _2nd Anisong Vocal Audition: Avex x 81produce “Wake Up, Girls!”_. It's quite a long title so I just called it "2nd Anisong Vocal Audition". It came back to bite me though during the second screening when I almost panicked in front of the examiners when I told them I was from Iwate and they started to write vigorously on their note. (laughs) When I got back home, I double-checked and only then did I realize that it was an audition specifically for characters in anime series set in Tohoku called _Wake Up, Girls!_. I honestly didn't expect to be selected so I already readied myself to look for a job once I get rejected.  

\[Kaya also auditioned for the role of Elly in Milky Holmes, a role that Yoppi also auditioned for, and Sasaki Mikoi, a fellow Iwate native and eventual friend, passed.\]

![sp-15112092000-12](/images/sp-15112092000-12.jpg)

**\-- Ah. So you just came in expecting to become an anime song singer instead of a voice actress?**  

OK: It was my final shot so I took any chance I could get to be part of the anime industry.  

**\-- Have you reached your ideal now that you've achieved your dream in becoming a voice actress?**  

OK: Not yet. I did become a voice actress like I dreamed but I want to expand my repertoire in terms of vocal range. I thought of becoming a voice actress when I realized could act out and mimic all the characters while watching anime. Right now, however, I get a lot of roles where I use a deep voice because of my role as Kikuma Kaya. I hope to use my other voices as well, my high voice and cute voice, for other characters.  

**\-- With the release of _Beyond the Bottom_ and your upcoming show in Makuhari Messe \[_Beyond the Bottom EXTEND_\] soon, this feels like a turning point for your group and I think it's safe to say that WUG’s activities will be continuing in the near future. Can you tell me what your hopes are moving forward?**  

OK: I hope we get to do more WUG activities as voice actresses. Like reading dramas... though I'm still bad at them. (laughs) Maybe something like that or live readings for our shows would be great. But most of all, I hope we do more activities that showcase our abilities as voice actresses so we can show that that aspect of us in addition to being idols.  

**\-- Finally, can you tell our readers what to look forward to in** **_Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom_****?**  

OK: I know a lot of fans are eagerly waiting for the conclusion, with all the foreshadowing and speculation from _Shadow of Youth_. Be assured that everything will be wrapped up in _Beyond the Bottom_ so don’t miss it!
