**Final Tour Memories**

I'm glad we were able to visit Nagano and Aichi, places we haven't gone to as WUG, for our final tour. Aichi especially; I always hoped we hold a live show there since I used to host a radio show in Gifu. Our entire tour schedule allowed us to stay an additional day before and after each show so I got to enjoy their local cuisine.

Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the horse sashimi we had in Kumamoto. Yoppi always insisted we try some if we ever go to Kumamoto and we finally did!

**Hometown Stop**

I got to do a segment for Part II Kishiwada so I took that chance to show what I can do and brought back a comedy skit I had originally written way back from our Osaka stop during the first live tour. I thought it would be a good idea and, thankfully, everyone was on-board with it, which encouraged me to go over and rewrite the entire scenario.

It’s still essentially the same thing but thanks to our experiences with the second WUG stage play \[_Aoba no Kiseki_\], our pace, delivery, and overall chemistry gave it an entirely different feel from before, and it really showed how much we’ve improved and grown closer to each other since then. 

Since we’re also doing reading dramas, I wrote a story for the Osaka stop titled “_Polaris 制作秘話_” \[TL: “The story behind _Polaris_”\]. It’s about how the lyrics for the song were written but framed as if our respective characters had done it themselves. I asked for everyone’s input when I was running out of ideas and in the process, it reminded me of how fortunate we were for having done it. The script actually became a limited special item for the prize lottery and it makes me really happy that people will actually get to read it themselves. I think of Polaris as a song made complete by everyone—us and the audience. We gather around in a circle with our backs to the audience, something we don’t usually have in our choreography, and we do a big chorus right at the end where everyone sings together all the way until the song ends.

[\[Link to Translated _Polaris_ interview. Includes details on the actual story behind its creation, song structure and how the lines were distributed.\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Wake%20Up,%20Girls!%20Shin%20Shou%20animate%20Interview%20Series%20No.%2012%20(1-11-2018)%20Polaris%20Interview.%20Thoughts%20and%20Feelings%20about%20Tohoku,%20Sendai,%20Fans%20and%20supporters)

Then to switch things up from Kishiwada, we also did our solo event songs in Osaka with each show featuring a different set of songs. We decided to do that because I had already done everything I set out to do for Osaka in Kishiwada and I couldn’t think of anything else to top that.

**New Songs**

There’s something about our SSA (Saitama Super Arena) Final Live happening on a Friday that makes me wonder if it inspired Tadano-sensei to name _Doyoubi no Flight_ \[TL: Saturday Flight\] that way. The show ends late in the evening so I can imagine our fans flying out to all sorts of places the next day while bringing the memories of last night’s show with them. It’s a song whose meaning becomes clearer the more you listen to it and its hook actually lies in the interlude, which, I believe, is a quality that it shares with _Polaris_. The lyrics speak a lot about us and relate a lot to us in a way that it could only be expressed by Tadano-sensei, who has watched us grow and struggle over the years. As such, I believe it’s one of those songs that could only be sung by us. 

_Sayonara no Parade_ is something I want everyone to experience live. We just finished mastering the choreography the other day and I can say that this is indeed WUG’s swan song. It calls back to everything we’ve done, and its message of being strong enough to move on amid painful goodbyes is something you would expect from WUG.

\[According to Tadano Natsumi, WUG’s primary lyricist, the title was entirely by coincidence though it did make the members legitimately wonder because they started recording the songs in December and SSA Final Live was announced on December 22 during Part II Yokosuka.\]

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

I’ve often been asked about that ever since the disband announcement and, honestly, it’s hard to pick one. It changes all the time and it just doesn’t feel right comparing one specific event to another. Right now, though, it would be the moments we spend in the dressing room. It’s always fun; we could let go and just be ourselves, and those moments make it clear what we feel toward each other. And I’m not just talking about the members but also the rest of the staff such as our make-up artists and stylists. It almost feels like we’re all classmates and everything about it makes me feel like I’m at the height of my youth.

This tour is a good example of that. I’d feel tired and exhausted with a lot on my mind but just being there with them—playing games, talking about whatever comes to mind, and whatever else we wind up doing—leaves me feeling recharged. It’s just a lot of fun and lately, our topic of conversation has mostly been about Nanami. 

**A Few Words for the Members**

Miyu, you’ve helped out, cried, panicked, and worried the most out of all of us... and it’s what kept me from losing my composure instead. Thank you and I hope that part of you never changes.

Nanami, there's a good chance we’ll see a lot more of each other even after WUG disbands so I hope we can talk and reminisce about WUG together.

Minami… you’re such a natural at what you do, it’s unfair. Thank you for inspiring WUG to aim higher. Thank you for pulling through the most during our toughest moments.

Airi, you’re the glue that keeps us together. You’re our maternal figure who knows what’s best for WUG and keeps us from straying too far from our goal and doing something we will regret. Thank you for always being there to help me up whenever I’m feeling down. 

Kaya, you’re a lifesaver every time we work together. Thank you for letting me bounce ideas off you when I'm at a loss. Let's hang out at your place again, okay?

Yoshino, we were like oil and water when we first met. We see each other as rivals but I often think you have the better of me and that I’ll never catch up to you, let alone beat you. I hope we stay competing and growing as both friends and rivals.

**Final Live**

To be honest, I feel nervous and anxious now that it’s so close. The other day, we went to SSA to see how preparations were getting along and it was already set up to its arena configuration. I saw how large the place actually is and I teared up a little, anxious of how it would look once the seats are full and worried if we can actually stand in the middle of all that. I felt overwhelmed.

But compared to when we first learned of the news, I feel a measure of excitement and anticipation. At first, everything was still up in the air and we only had a vague idea of how it would all go. But as we deliberated on the setlist, saw the stage layout, and proposed our ideas, it slowly became more real and I started looking forward to it. It motivated me to create the best show imaginable for everyone not just because it’s SSA and the reputation it holds, but because it’s our final show and our fans want to see us there because they believe this is where we truly belong. They’ve always believed in us, even in times where I felt uncertain.

I want this concert to be our way of responding to all the support our fans have given us over the years, as well as a heartfelt show of gratitude to new fans who will see us for the first time, and for those who came to say goodbye. That’s the sentiment I intend to bring with me when I stand on that stage. The songs we sing will be our last so I want to cherish each and every moment… and leave a strong impression up until the very end. I want to leave a lasting legacy that we've always shone our brightest as WUG.

**Final Tour Memories**

Miyu brought some pretty neat DJ instruments that she let us play around with when we were rehearsing for our Nagano stop. It was a lot of fun. I took a few videos that I’m planning to share with our fan club. Mayu looked so cool, you could almost mistake her for the real thing.

As for food, no doubt it was the horse sashimi in Kumamoto. It was my first time there and at my age, I never expected to still discover food that delicious. The karashi-renkon (fried lotus root with mustard) that Yoppi always recommended completely blew my expectations and I ended up getting some for the trip home. Since we get an extra day to ourselves after every stop, we spent the night after the concert drinking some light sake and those moments are stark reminders that we’re all grownups now.

**Hometown Stop**

WUG didn’t just grow through our efforts alone so when they asked me to handle the segment for the Sendai stop, I decided to hand the floor over to the people who have brought us this far over the years. However, that's easier said than done so we settled on doing a video presentation focused on Sendai, with the footage we shot there also serving as our thanks to everyone.

**New Songs**

Simply dancing to _Sayonara no Parade_ is enough to make me cry. It’s a song that completely embodies our six years as a group, from the lyrics down to the choreography that SATOMI-sensei, our choreographer since the very beginning, designed to include elements from all our songs. So if you watch us perform it, you might also find yourself equally moved as you recall memories associated with them.

Learning the choreography went smoothly. Back then, we couldn’t even manage _Tachiagare_ and we were in tears the entire time. This time, we mastered _Sayonara no Parade_ in about three hours. I feel proud because it's proof of our improvement over the years but perhaps the fact that it’s the last time we get to do this as WUG loomed over our heads and we just wanted to bury our emotions and finish as quickly as possible.

\[According to anecdotes, it took them about a month to learn _Tachiagare_. Additionally, the choreography itself underwent a few changes since their debut at WonderFes 2013 until the WUG Festa 2014.\]

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**  

What’s most memorable to me are the live shows. Setting foot on stage makes me feel alone but also not because I hear the cheers from the audience and I see them move and wave their light sticks; those make each and every moment special and totally unique. It means so much to me that once I get home after every show, I’d just hole up in my room and cry, feeling completely drained. (laughs)

The atmosphere of a live show where you sing and dance together with so many people is an experience you don’t get on a regular basis. It makes those moments irreplaceable, that's why I want to stay there for as long as possible. Those opportunities will come fewer and far apart once WUG is over, so as I look back, I realize how those moments truly are invaluable to me.

The 4th Live Tour stands out as the most fulfilling. Mayushii and I racked our brains over so many details, from the setlist to the outfits. I’m so happy though because we’ve heard nothing but good things from everyone who attended. We poured our heart and soul into making an exciting tour with our own ideas so it was very fulfilling when it came together.

\[The members’ involvement with the 4th Live Tour (and event preparations as a whole) can be traced back to the 2nd Live Tour where they were invited to participate in the process and, when asked, they suggested they wanted to do a proper concert this time around (song after song, without any breaks other than MC and outfit changes) which staff accommodated for. Over time, they were given free rein to certain aspects of various events; setlists for smaller live shows, Mayu’s reading segments, and intro readings, Yoppi’s drawings, etc.  
  
4th Live’s involvement began from Mayu’s wishful suggestion if they could decide the entire setlist by themselves. To her surprise, staff approved it and that extended to most of the tour preparations (which they mostly attributed to Airi) since it was, as did most of their activities in 2017, primarily meant to promote Shin Shou that was set to air by the end of the year.\]

**A Few Words for the Members**

Mayushii, we’ve known each other since the very first audition screening and I still remember how you offered to practice dialogue with me to help me get over my nerves. Now you’re someone I’ve come to rely on all the time and a friend I can talk to about anything. I know you always try to play it cool and hide it, but that adorably cute, awkward side is as much a part of you as well.

\[Mayu and Airi (and later Minami, who was with them as they had consecutive candidate numbers) were in the same group that was auditioning for the eventual role of Shimada Mayu before getting separated. The two didn’t interact at first but their mothers did, which eventually broke the ice.  
  
Early on, it was Airi who directly addressed Mayu’s apparent lack of girlish charm. She would rate Mayu’s clothing choices, try to get her to act cute (through acting or dance), and would proclaim every chance she gets that there’s a cute side to Mayu that she wishes she shows off more often.\] 

Miyu, you were such a crybaby back then and I feel a little sad now that you’ve grown out of it. (laughs) You turned from an adorable 16-year-old girl into a proper adult in what felt like such a short time that it just hit me how all of us had matured as well. You possess a bright-eyed charm and a demeanor that never shies away from anything. Watching you never fails to cheer me up. Thank you for your persistent smile.

Nanami, we had such a tough time at the training camp, we even considered quitting at one point. But I’m glad we stuck with it and made it through until the end. You’re extremely capable, and you shine so brightly on stage that I can’t help but watch and learn from it. I find it incredible that you exist, someone who is both aloof and level-headed in ways that seem impossible.

Minami, you’re my favorite no matter what because you’re so adorable. You’re like everyone’s little sister. But I know that’s not all there is about you. You’re stoic, serious, and there’s an intriguing part of you that not a lot of people know. Because WUG is a group full of strong-minded girls, it’s no question we get into our share of arguments. Thank you for always being there and ready to mediate. I’m glad you’re part of WUG. 

Kaya, we didn’t hit it off at first but we’ve gotten so close since then that we often chat until four in the morning. There’s so much mystery about you that I’ve yet to fathom and so many good things about you that others have yet to realize. You’re someone I can turn to talk about life and open up to about our worries. I hope someday we can visit Tohoku together again.

Yoppi, you’re just as amazing as Mayushii, but in a different way. You have a way of setting the tone on stage, and your ability to take in and accept all the negative vibes that come with it—all the worry, frustration, and anxiety—is second to none. There’s a lot about you I envy. You show off your strengths and expose your weaknesses with pride, which also lets us loosen up and be ourselves. You really do have what it takes to be a leader. Thank you for taking on the role. 

\[Yoppi was arbitrarily assigned the role of leader and while she often wrote about how unfit she was for it because of her personality and her inability to express herself well (citing her lack of vocabulary, and tendency to be misunderstood and the fear associated with it), she often cited being WUG’s leader as the reason for her to step up and improve because, regardless, she felt responsible for being a leader and setting a good example. The members regularly praised her ability to make impromptu speeches, both the ones she would do as they huddle before a show and the ones closing their MC segments, because she always knew the right words to say and the members often quoted her for their own MC and blog posts, both jokingly and seriously (ie. The members’ reference to a “Second Chapter” started from her final live letter).\]

**Final Live**

I’m going to miss it a lot. We’ve talked about it; about how close it is, that it’s just two months away, and how we really don’t want things to end. But I know I’ll have the time of my life on that stage in an arena filled completely by our fans. At first, we got worried if we could even get people to come but it seems it wasn’t an issue at all. Now, I’m glad we have the place all to ourselves and that is something to be proud of. I want them to see the full extent of what we can do and show them a performance so spectacular, it’ll leave them wanting more. We will make people regret, especially the ones who will see us perform for the first time, for not coming to see us sooner. I want it to be legendary. I want it to leave a mark in history.

No doubt I’ll be crying but I’ll do my best to show everyone who I am. That this is me, Eino Airi. That I can be cool, but also funny, and over the top. I want to show everyone that Wake Up, Girls! is brimming with talent. That it is and will ever be the best group out there. So I hope everyone is ready. We’ll see you there!

\[The disband announcement sparked a lot of changes in the members, but Airi most especially. It started a streak of self-confidence that wasn’t entirely present before (or rather, it’s a different kind of confidence from before) and even now, especially when she discovered her love of theater acting, she’s always ready to show everyone who she is, what she’s capable of, and how she wants to go about it.\]

## Tanaka Minami

**Final Tour Memories**

I was touched by the response in Yokosuka when we announced our Final Live. I can still remember how loudly they celebrated, and our friends and family who were there later told us they even saw some people break down in tears. We were feeling anxious since we’ve never done a show of that scale, so hearing our fans welcome the news with so much emotion brought us to tears as well. 

In Kumamoto and Osaka, everyone—the members, managers, make-up artists, stylists, and the rest of the staff—got together to eat somewhere. We had horse sashimi in Kumamoto! We took videos and I ended up eating quite a lot. Then we had a full-course meal in Osaka which consisted of tonpei-yaki (flat grilled pork) and all sorts of flour-based dishes. I was tabling with Miyu, Yoppi, and Nanami, and Yoppi and Miyu ate everything as soon as they got it. They even scurried over to Aichan, Mayushii, and Kaya, who barely touched theirs, to try and get portions off them. Everything was so delicious, I couldn’t help myself getting more.

**Hometown Stop**

I suggested doing a karaoke showcase for our shows in Zama, Kanagawa. We spend a lot of time in the dressing room to relax, let our hair down, and be ourselves as we goof off, watch niconico videos, and the like, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to show that kind of energy on stage through karaoke. This tour also provided an opportunity to include ideas that we couldn’t fit into the previous tour such as reading dramas, which emphasize our skills as voice actresses.

I also sang my character’s version of _Non stop diamond hope_ in Zama. I love that song and I enjoyed recording it so much that I put in a lot of effort trying to convey Katayama Minami’s sense of innocence and positivity. Singing it actually made me realize a lot of things so I was glad that I was able to sing it in Kanagawa and see the entire hall light up yellow. 

\[_Non stop diamond hope_ (_Nsdh_) is a character song with seven different versions, each with different verse lines depending on the character singing it, but with a common theme and chorus; it emphasized each character’s different aspects while still linking them together. At this point, WUG had mostly been doing anime tie-ups, and _7 Senses_, while a WUG song, was conceptualized as a WUG unit tie-up, so _Nsdh_ became an opportunity for them to reconnect and learn deeper about their respective character as they were asked to lean heavily into them once again.\]

**New Songs**

The new songs were done entirely by MONACA’s composers, specifically the ones that had worked with us since the very beginning, and they were there to provide direction as we recorded.

_Doyoubi no Flight_ is song full of meaning. The composition is whimsical and easy to get into that it made me wonder how to impart deep emotions into it. Then I tried singing it and I realized that it wasn’t such a happy song after all. Recording for it brought up a lot of memories with Tadano Natsumi-san portrayal of the realities presented by WUG hitting deeply with each line.

_Kotoba no Kesshou_ was so challenging that it had me doubting if we could even sing and properly express its message; we had to be expressionless while singing very emotionally, and the choreography was intensely difficult that, after frantically practicing it three times, we were still anxious and unsure how it would turn out. It’s a song that isn’t heavy on words and sounds, so I encourage our fans to listen closely so they can fully absorb the meaning it’s trying to convey.

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

Every recording session we did together was a chance to see how each of us had grown which, in turn, related to our own personal growth. Since we’re a group that started together from the bottom with no experience whatsoever, we’ve become very conscious of that progress, and it’s rewarding when we see each other grow from strength to strength. That feeling really came into focus during our Osaka stop in January. We performed all our solo event songs and you could see how wildly different each of us were, from our preferences, to our tendencies, to the vision that we wanted to project with each song. 

WUG may be a group of seven but we also let our individual qualities, which we honed and developed through our own experiences with other activities, shine through as we make each and every show the best it can be.

**A Few Words for the Members**

Miyu, I’m worried that you’ll eat too much at SSA and get so nervous that you’ll get a stomachache. We need you at your best so try not to do that, okay? The way you start off our MC segments on a bright and positive note is always a huge help.

\[They frequently cited how they used to have trouble doing MC segments where they would have moments of awkward silence, and their spiels sounded short, stiff, and generic. It became a cause of concern for Miyu so for the 2nd Live Tour she suggested they plan topics and delegate roles for those segments so it would flow more naturally. Eventually, they grew comfortable with each other that those segments became essentially impromptu comedic (and emotional) segments in their own way.\]

Nanami, you’re such a natural on stage but I know deep down how much you take things into consideration, though it surprises me how completely unfazed you are at times before we get on stage. I hope that keeps up so we can show an effortless performance when the day comes. 

Mayushii, thank you for always trusting me with your worries. You’ve done great as our center. It’s your voice that sets the stage in all our shows, and I can’t wait for it to reverberate far and wide in SSA.

Aichan, you’re like the motherly figure that keeps our group focused and working together. I admire how determined you are to stick to your guns once you decide on something and still be the same person who goofs off and makes jokes in the dressing room. The way you dance is so entrancing, I can watch it forever. 

Kayatan, I think there’s no one else that thinks about and loves WUG and Tohoku as much as you do. You always have a way with words, especially during MC segments so I’m looking forward to what you’ll come up with in SSA.

Yoppi, with the way you love WUG with all your heart, I’m half-expecting you to cry at the first song. (laughs) You did great, especially in Kumamoto, and I’m excited to see you say the best things and put out the best performance at our final show. 

**Final Live**

It feels so real now that every day feels like it’s counting down to it. I don’t feel that nervous but I am grappling with all sorts of complicated emotions. It’s our last time together on stage so I can imagine some people coming to see us after not having done so in so long, and it makes me anxious how they’ll see me now and if I could do a good job showing them how much I’ve grown.

I’d like to think it’s fate why we’re having our final show in SSA. Having performed there numerous times as part of Anisama (Animelo Summer Live), we’ve always wanted to do a concert all to ourselves there someday. I’m sure some of the audience will only have this chance to see us for the first time so I want to show them the best show possible while also presenting ourselves as who we’ve always been. The songs we sing there will be our last as the group so I want to show everyone everything there is about WUG. This will be our biggest concert ever so let’s all come together and make the loudest noise we can make!

## Aoyama Yoshino

**Final Tour Memories**

It makes me glad they enjoyed the food in Kumamoto. A lot of the girls only eat in small portions, kind of how you imagine rabbits do, but I wanted them to have a pleasant experience with the food of my hometown so I went ahead and recommended all sorts of things, especially those you can’t find or make anywhere else. They really loved them and they ate so much, even Minami; she was so silent that I didn’t realize she ended up getting two plates of tamagokakegohan (raw egg with white rice).

My personal favorite would have to be the naengmyeon (cold noodles) we had in Iwate. We wanted to try Morioka’s variety so we went to a yakiniku place. There were so many of us so we got split into separate tables; I was with our choreographer ASAMI-sensei, and a concert staff member, and we loved everything we ordered. Iwate’s tankakugyou (shorthorn cattle) is very delicious and you could tell how well they were raised, that a lot of good food, care and attention went into them. It also became a good opportunity for me to bond with people other than the girls so it was a great experience all-around. 

**Hometown Stop**

I’ve always wanted to do a show in Kumamoto so I could fully express the feelings I carry for it. Kumamoto is where I grew up and what shaped me into who I am now, and I wanted to take my experiences growing with the girls in Tokyo and bring them all together into that show. I longed to sing _Watashi no Ki_ since the \[2016\] earthquake struck the region, but it didn’t sit well with me to sing it entirely solo so I had the girls sing with me for the chorus. Doing that felt right because it was as if we’re fulfilling our responsibility as WUG to help regions hit by earthquakes heal and rebuild.  

\[[Linked is a full recap of Final Tour Part III Kumamoto from instigare](http://oha.yoppi.moe/2019/01/05/yoshinos-tree/)\]

In the Final Tour Part I pamphlet, I talked about my time in the choir club and I mentioned my teacher adviser. She actually went to the show! She’s quite strict when it comes to decorum and etiquette, and it was actually due to her influence that the initial impression I got after joining WUG was for being uptight. It worried me a bit so I sent her a really long letter as part of my seasonal greetings and I immediately went straight to her after the show where she greeted me with a barrage of musical terms that left me winded. (laughs) She told me how surprised she was seeing our fans united as one doing call and cheers. She even praised me for being the best singer. Hearing that from her made me so happy because I never got that from her during my time in the club and it’s still a point of pride I carry with me whenever I go on stage. 

\[According to previous interviews (I currently don’t have Part I pamphlet), Yoppi’s pre-WUG experience can be summed up in the choir club. She spent most of her school time there during middle school and high school, learning skills, practicing for competitions before and after classes, etc. While developing her singing, she also learned a few other things that she brought over to WUG, namely letter writing (which she occasionally used for one reason or another), proper etiquette, and strict adherence to seniority, the latter two being the reasons why the initial impression they had for her was being too stiff and formal. There was even an incident during the training camps where Kaya casually refused Yoppi’s offer to take the first bath (They were rooming and seniority says Kaya has to take it first) which left her confused and a little shocked.\]

**New Songs**

We have four new songs and the ones that made me cry were _Sayonara no Parade_, _Umi Soshite Shutter Doori_, and especially _Kotoba no Kesshou_, which felt like an evolution for WUG. _Doyoubi no Flight_ is a strange one; the somber mood it’s trying to convey hits you harder when you sing it live.

There are so many things worth pointing out in _Kotoba no Kesshou_ but what really left an impression on me was that we had to sing it while suppressing our emotions. That was new to me. I love leaning to emotion when I sing, where I put emphasis into lines that express strong emotions such as sadness and pain. So when Hirokawa-san asked us to sing as if we’re a piece of acrylic board, devoid of emotion, it threw me for a loop. I later realized what he was going for once I heard the entire thing and with it, I learned a new approach to musical expression that doesn’t rely on emotions alone.

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

I keep coming back to our very first recording session. All of us auditioned for all sorts of reasons; we wanted to be voice actresses, we all wanted to sing, but we also have our own goals. So at first, I was a whirlwind mess of emotions, wants, and desires. I came in primarily wanting to become a voice actress so I can’t even explain how fulfilled I felt when I finally got in front of the mic. That ended up working against me though because it got me so worked up, I suffered an anxiety attack… A lot of things were on my mind at the time—dancing, singing, acting, being a leader—all of which I wasn’t very good at. But I slowly got the hang of things and started improving thanks to our manager at the time who was always there to motivate me, and our sound director, Kikuta Hiromi-san, who patiently taught me how things are done. 

[\[Linked Famitsu Long Interview #1 where I noted their respective reasons for auditioning.\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Wake%20Up,%20Girls!%20Famitsu%20Long%20Interview%20No.%201%20Yoshioka%20Mayu,%20Eino%20Airi,%20Aoyama%20Yoshino,%20and%20Okuno%20Kaya%20(3-7-2019))

**A Few Words for the Members**

Miyu, we’ve spent the most time together eating out, drinking alcohol, and chatting about everything under the sun. We’re both stubborn, and we often don’t think before we speak, which tends to lead into arguments, but that just shows how comfortable I am around you. Let’s keep eating delicious food together and I hope we find each other sharing a stage again someday.  

Nanami, when I first learned that you weren’t aiming to be a voice actress, it actually got on my nerves that I wanted to lash out at you. You just have so much going for you that I wish I had, especially your voice. I’m sorry that I thought that way. I slowly came to realize that beyond that, you’re also one of the most hardworking people I know. I want to learn and be more like you as I continue in this career.

Minami, if there’s something I needed to work out, you’re always there to give your opinion. It’s not just me. I’m sure the rest of us would say the same thing. You don’t always open yourself up to people, though that also makes you the most cool-headed and mature out of all of us. I hope we can still keep in touch and mess around like we always do.

Mayushii, you and I had that fight on the very first day we met at the training camp and it became so memorable, people would always bring that up between us. Now though, talking to you always ends up becoming very productive, and I’m glad you’re someone I can turn to and chat about anything and everything. I have to say though, I prefer you being cute.

\[Mayu mentioned in a MyCloset stream that Yoppi is usually the person she turns to when she needs a second opinion on any piece she’s currently writing. She jokes she doesn’t really offer anything constructive but her positive comments help her confidence. Conversely, when Yoppi needs something written, she turns to Mayu because she appreciates the kind of unconventional humor she brings to her writing.\]

Aichan, I remember the relief that washed over me when I first met you because, like me, you didn’t seem as extraordinary. I wish you remembered more of it but there was a time way back when we stayed in the same place, but I guess that just shows how comfortable we were living together.

\[Airi and Yoppi stayed in the same place in Tokyo during the 2nd Live Tour because they were still finishing their studies at the time and hadn’t officially moved to Tokyo. This was also a common point between them that they bonded over since it meant they didn’t get as many work opportunities at the time and it made them miss group events, so they would encourage themselves to finish their individual responsibilities.\]

Kayatan, we share the same wavelength when it comes to approaching our career as voice actresses, there was even a time where we called each other on the phone just to practice line deliveries. You’re my kindred spirit and I can’t help being just as happy as you whenever you land a new role or project. I love your voice so much, I wish I could be with you forever.

**Final Live**

It dawned on me now that we’re ending how we’re at the best condition we’ve ever been. We’re all worried about going our separate ways but right now, it really does feel like our morale has never been better. And with the fans, it’s as if WUG is finally bringing everyone together. It’s unfortunate that it took our impending disband for it to happen but I can’t deny, especially now, how that one reason inspired so many people to come together and how it changed everything.

It’s heartbreaking that it’s ending, but we will show everyone the best time of their lives in SSA so I want everyone not to think too hard on it and to just enjoy the show. A lot of people will be there, old fans and new, so I want to leave with them our strongest impression. I also see this as a new start for all of us. WUG ending doesn’t truly mean the end, it only means the start of a new chapter as the seven of us open new doors to new possibilities, and I hope everyone sees it that way too.

**Final Tour Memories**

We did something new in Nagano—we had a snowball fight. It took us by surprise how much snow had piled up when we left the bullet train. As someone from Tokushima, I don’t usually see that much snow so seeing everything covered with a silvery layer of white was a sign telling me that everything will go very well. It had already gotten dark by the time we finished rehearsals to play in the snow where Yoppi ended up becoming a snowball magnet, which is kind of expected. (laughs) Airi was really good; the snow was quite soft and easy to work with so she would quickly ball them up and immediately throw them straight at Yoppi.

As for food, catering brought in some very delicious soup in Iwate. It was so sweet and it had little dumplings in it that looked like candy. I ended up having three bowlfuls and it hyped me up, feeling glad that they prepared us something that we’ll never get anywhere else other than Iwate.

**Hometown Stop**

The collaboration with Sudachi-kun, my hometown’s gentle regional mascot, was my idea. Kaya and Yoppi arranged emotionally moving plans for their hometown stops so I wanted to do the same for Tokushima and turn it into a more light-hearted experience, which I felt was a good representation of both Tokushima and who I am as a person. As a sort of centerpiece, we did an all-member version of _Ookami to Piano._ Our fans seem to really love that song since it was the only character song featured in both fan-voted setlists for Green Leaves Fes, and having performed it solo so many times, I wanted this last one to be done by all of us.

The afternoon show featured a love story starring me and Sudachi-kun, then it was between me and Mayushii for the evening show, where she took on the role of a dashing hero to switch things up. Both heroes wore a red cape and they would come out by the time I reach the line in _Ookami to Piano_, “HERO ne hirugaeru makkana Anata no manto” \[TL: The hero appears wearing a fluttering red cape\].

**New Songs**

In _Kotoba no Kesshou_, the “naru” in “toumei ni~naru” \[LIT: To turn transparent; TL: To fade into nothing\] went through many revisions during the process of recording, from a whisper to a booming echo. Hirokawa Keiichi-san and Tadano Natsumi-san gave me two different approaches—Hirokawa-san suggested to sing it without expressing emotion, while Tadano-san suggested singing in a way that felt as if I was fading away. I liked both so I was still unsure when it came time to record. (laughs) In the end, we settled with Tadano-san’s approach. It has a very delicate delivery so I worried how it would go in a live show but I was able to pull it off. The dance is also quite difficult. I never expected we would be doing something like that as one of our final songs, but it is a song that is made complete by both us and our fans.

\[They often talk about _Kotoba no Kesshou_ as one of the final songs that need to be experienced live because the idea behind it is more theatrical, with a focus on choreography, lighting, and expression (or lack thereof) instead of just the song itself. Where the audience completes it is right before the final emotional chorus, where the lights completely go out as everything goes silent.\]

In _Doyoubi no Flight_, my lines convey deep emotions so I thought hard finding a way to properly express them. Should I draw from my own emotions? Or from past memories? Or appeal to tried-and-true sentiments? All of them demand a completely different approach. In the end, I decided to go for a nonchalant, measured rendition, as if I'm trying to keep my emotions in check.

I think the lyrics of the new songs are ultimately trying to do one thing—they’re telling something about us from their own viewpoint. They’re all speak true and they’re expressing things that we couldn’t in our own words.

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

I feel very contented. We’ve been seeing each other more and more lately, not just for tour shows and rehearsals, but also photoshoots, interviews, and guest appearances on various programs, and each time we spend a lot of time together. We often chat about anything that comes to mind, what we feel about the tour, and what we’ll do for the Final Live. We’ve also thought about our fans more than ever, that’s why this period of time feels very fulfilling.

We’re actually planning to have a sort of WUG graduation trip after all of this wraps up. We’ve been together all this time going to all sorts of places for the tour, but never just for our own sakes. So if our schedules line up, we want to go somewhere, maybe to a hot spring or somewhere overseas. We’re not sure yet. Right now though, we have to put our heads together for our Final Live so it’s a given that we’ve also been slipping into reminiscing about the years we’ve shared.

**A Few Words for the Members**

Miyu, we’ve all gone through ups and downs and you’re always there to lift our spirits and get us to see things in a positive light. The way you speak never fails to cheer me up and motivate me. No amount of thanks is enough.

Minami, we run into each other more often than not in our other projects and I can’t help but look up to you being so dedicated to them. Moving forward, I hope to become someone who can compete and improve alongside you.

If there’s anyone who can complement my aloof demeanor, it’s you, Mayushii. I feel bad for always having to rely on you, though. I know you’re someone who’s careful and makes certain of things before committing, so I hope me and my stubbornly decisive nature can be helpful to you even after WUG ends. 

Airi, we can always rely on you to see things with a cool head and in a broader perspective. You’re like our supervisor and editor, all in one, and with your help, a lot of decisions behind the scenes get made. Thank you for all the hard work.

Kaya, I couldn’t understand you at all at first and though I have gotten better at it, six years on and there are still things I can’t wrap my head around. But I think that’s the strongest part of your charm and I hope I can still be around to watch you.

Yoppi, you’re someone who would rather rush headfirst into any obstacle in order to overcome it, but that makes you such a great leader that we’re comfortable being ourselves. Thank you for being who you are.

**Final Live**

Right now, I feel ready to see things through. I could hardly believe it when we learned it was going to happen but all the strong gestures of support from everyone since the announcement completely blew away all my anxieties. We’re being given such a huge stage so it’s better to prepare myself being on it instead of worrying about what might come. I can be indecisive at times but nothing can stop me once I set myself to something. The six years we shared together, through all the joys and hardships, had been the most eventful time in my life thus far. 

After the disband announcement, a lot of people have asked what WUG means to me and I couldn’t put the answer I really wanted to give in such simple and easy terms. So I want that stage and that show to be the place for me to show our fans, with unhindered sincerity, what WUG was and still is in my life.

**Final Tour Memories**

The dago-jiru (rice dumpling soup) we had in Kumamoto was really good, especially the way the miso contributed to its taste. I remember thinking about how I could learn a thing or two from it.

We wanted to do a lot of interesting ideas for each stop this tour, but the one for Nagano caused Miyu to cry out of worry because it was her turn and she couldn’t think of anything. She was so adorable. I was watching in anticipation for the moment she cries, and I think Yoppi had the same thought because she had that look when we glanced at each other. (laughs) In the end, we consoled her and suggested that DJing would be a perfectly good idea and that’s how it turned out.

**Hometown Stop**

I had always assumed that doing a show in a remote place like Iwate wasn’t feasible because our live shows tend to be held in venues on the western side of Japan. Nevertheless, I wanted people to see Iwate and come to love it because it’s where I grew up, and what inspired me was Miyazawa Kenji’s _イーハトーブの風_. It depicted vivid imagery of his hometown of Iwate, which was a perfect fit with FANTASIA, Part II’s subtitle.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0jJkahi-1g

I thought of inviting the chorus group IHATOV SINGERS since my mom and my sister are members and this presented a wonderful opportunity to have them perform on stage. I asked my mom if she could talk to Director Ootashiro Masataka about it and while I felt certain it would work, I did feel anxious of how our fans would take to it since they were coming for a concert featuring voice actresses. My mom, however, told me not to worry and to sing like we usually do because our emotions will carry through regardless.

I sang _Kotonoha Aoba_ with the choir group during the afternoon show, then the rest of the girls joined me for the evening. The whole experience felt surreal. I was so overcome by emotion for my home that I got carried away and couldn’t sing, but Yoppi, who was beside me, did her best to cover for me. It could tell she knew how much I wanted it to be a success, which completely reassured me and motivated me to do the same for her in Kumamoto.

\[The Part II Iwate turned out to be one of the most memorable stops in the entire tour with _Kotonoha Aoba_ becoming one of the featured pieces for IHATOV SINGERS when they performed their 5th year anniversary concert. Many WUG fans also turned up for the anniversary concert. Kaya’s mother and sister wore WUG tour shirts during the encore and even asked them to stay after the concert to have a group photo with them.\]

**New Songs**

I love _Kotoba no Kesshou’_s crushing feeling of dread and its sense of desperation as things begin to fall apart and emotions come to a head is very intense. I also love the choreography; it was difficult to master but once we did, I was really taken in how each movement felt like it perfectly matched every beat. It’s one of those performances where you have to keep watching intently because you won’t want to miss a second of it

_Doyoubi no Flight_ also deserves a mention. It was the first song I came in to record and listening to it was where it finally hit me that we’re all going our separate ways. That WUG really is ending. The song is a plea asking whoever listens to it to acknowledge our anxieties but I really did feel anxious as we recorded, which made it painful to sing. (laughs) That aside, it's calming melody did get me enamored. Since it references the day after our Final Live, it’s definitely something to listen to. 

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

I thought I’d already felt it a long time ago but I can definitely say that I feel truly fulfilled now. For a long time, we worked as hard as we could and only pursued what was laid down in front of us. We didn’t have time or energy to think of anything else because we either had to succeed or at least make it work somehow. But lately, it’s been heavily weighing on me how little time we have left and it’s pushing me to just go out there and tell everyone what I feel. I want to cherish each and every moment we have on stage, sharing our feelings with everyone.

**A Few Words for the Members**

Miyu, you’re probably the one that makes me laugh the most. There’s never a dull moment with you in the dressing room. I’d feel sleepy and exhausted, but you always manage to turn it around and leave me feeling recharged and ready to do it all over again. I’m glad you’re with us. Kikuma Kaya may act cold toward Okamoto Miyu but whenever we banter through them, deep down I always wanted to add, “... But I like you, too.”

Nanami, being around you always feels like being in an anime. You just have that voice that makes even mundane everyday chats feel that way, and I imagine your fans feel like they’re in heaven whenever they get the chance to speak with you. (laughs) There’s a lot of things that only you can do and things only you can even think of, and it makes me glad how we sometimes come up with the same ideas and how often we laugh at the same things.

Minami, I think you’re truly amazing. Everything about where you are right now speaks volumes of all the hard work you do as you give your all into being a voice actress and take in everything that comes your way. I do worry a little though. You always put up a strong front and keep everything under control, and I worry that you might be isolating yourself a bit. Having said that, your cool-headed demeanor is what makes you awesome in my eyes.

\[Minami initially had a somewhat fearsome impression because of her capacity to stay cool under any sort of pressure. That and the fact that she rarely opens up about herself made the members wonder if she was truly an emotionless robot. Kaya’s impression of that changed when Mayu and Yoppi fought during the first training camp. Kaya asked Minami how she was feeling and she cried, wishing both of them to get along because she likes being with them.\]

It’s been so long since I had a nice long chat with you, Mayushii. You’re always very thorough and forward-thinking, and your dedication in pursuing your ideal is something I admire and wish to learn from. Thank you for leading by example and for pushing WUG into what it is.

\[The members regularly wrote about Mayu early on in the blog for just about everything she does, from practice sessions, to performances, to the ideas she tries to carry out. Some even wrote that it was because they wanted to catch up to her that they improved the way they did. In some cases, especially with theater, it was due to her influence that inspired that change. On the other hand, they also teased her for her fashion choices, her weakness to anything scary, and her constant troubles in trying to be cute.\]

Airi, you’ve been my constant source of support ever since the decision to disband came. We’ve gotten a lot closer than ever lately, and I’m grateful that you’re always there to listen to my concerns about the future, ready to turn all those fears upside down. I think that’s what’s great about you.

Yoppi, I always look forward to locking eyes with you every performance since we tend to be near each other a lot. You’re kind and gentle, and I wish you all the best.

**Final Live**

We really are going to have SSA all to ourselves... It finally sunk in completely and I’m confident we can make it a big success. It’s like a dream come true though I still can’t imagine how it will be on that stage since we’re never done a solo concert of that scale before.

The show’s subtitle is “Omoide no Parade” (Parade of Memories). It was initially written entirely in English, which didn’t feel right for WUG if you compare it our other subtitles, “Shichinin no Idol” and “Seishun no Kage”. So we took the “Parade” in _Sayonara no Parade_ then we put our heads together to think of something to add before it. We didn’t want it to sound depressing, but making it too positive would also feel wrong. Then came “Omoide no Parade” once we thought of the years we shared together and all the memories it brought, and we reached an agreement right away.

This will be the last time the seven of us will stand together on stage as a group. The songs we sing, the performances we put out, anything and everything, it will be our last. That’s why we’ll impart all the feelings we carry—of gratitude, sadness, enjoyment, perseverance, all of it—into this show. We won’t waste a single moment, I can assure that. Thank you for finding us, meeting us, and I hope your love for WUG stays forever.

**Final Tour Memories**

We’ll all probably mention Kumamoto but it really did leave such an impression because it was our first time there and the food was great. The horse sashimi we got even had puffs of dry ice wafting from it. It was delicious and we even enjoyed it with sake! We had fun joking around and chatting about all sorts of things, like how impressive Mayushii’s performing mannerisms are, and how each of us has our own way of dancing, which even got our choreographer to join.

For a show in particular, Kaya’s idea to invite the IHATOV SINGERS for Iwate was a huge stand out. There were a lot of tears from the audience, and it got Tohoku under the spotlight. It also got me thinking a lot more than ever about us. Because Part I aimed for a party atmosphere, Part II, especially the Iwate show, really brought home the fact that we’re disbanding.

**Hometown Stop**

The tour kicked off in Ichihara, Chiba, and it was our very first event following our disband announcement. We were anxious of how it will go, but we decided to set a fun and positive tone right from the get-go and start things off with _SHIFT_ followed by two other energetic songs. We also performed a character song medley, and we even did _Seventeen Crisis_, in which I’m the center of.

Then in Nagano, where I act as the promotional mascot character Namiki-chan for IIda’s city festival, it was my turn to come up with my own ideas so I thought of doing a DJ set. It seemed an interesting idea since I’ve already done that for my 2018 Solo Event, where I mixed my favorite anisongs, and this presented another opportunity to do it. Since it’s part of the tour, I decided to focus on WUG songs and I prepared it entirely on my own! One thing I’m particularly proud of was the transition between _Seventeen Crisis_ and _Platinum Sunrise_; they have the same tempo, which makes for a perfect pair.

\[DJing is now one of Miyu main skillsets as a talent. She officially debuted in one of Mogra’s 9th anniversary celebration events, where she introduced herself as “a voice actress who loves I’ve Sound” and later bought her own DJ set so she could focus on it on her own time (at one point she did an unintentional all-nighter as she prepared her set). Since WUG’s disband, she’s been invited to DJ events on a regular basis as DJ 高木美佑 with her sets currently having a general focus on anisongs.\]

**New Songs**

Our songs aren’t always happy and uplifting and the new songs are a good example of that. Sometimes they put into focus things we don’t usually notice, such as those in the periphery or under the surface, so we were anxious of how our fans would take to them as they hear it for the first time. I think they’re all pretty awesome in their own way, and they’re easy to understand and get into so I was hoping our fans would feel the same. I also think it’s an evolution of our style because the performances also made good use of lighting and other effects.

I came in to record _Kotoba no Kesshou_ first so we wound up doing a lot of variations. Hirokawa-san emphasized that we should sound flat and unemotional for most of it before going all out in a blaze of emotions by the end. I wasn’t completely sure how it would all turn out, but we kept exploring ideas until it felt right.

The last one I recorded was for Kosaki-san’s _Sayonara no Parade_. The notes, chords and even the lines were callbacks to _Tachiagare_, and I couldn’t help but feel like crying the whole time. What the lyrics are trying to communicate is that we have to press on even though it pains us to say goodbye, a sentiment that resonates deeply with us right now.

\[One thing worth noting is that because MONACA handled all of WUG’s songs (except _One in a Billion_, _Ou-sama no Cadenza_, and _Heartline_ which were done under Wake Up, May’n and FlyingDog), they gained a bit of a reputation for their songs sounding WUG-like. Whether or not that’s true (they mentioned it in an interview that potential clients point that out), the relationship between WUG and MONACA developed to a point where every WUG song became sort of a challenge and a chance to experiment for both the composers and the unit in terms of concept, composition, harmony, instrumentation, even how lines get distributed between members.  
  
It wasn’t uncommon for the members to contribute and learn about the entire process, as some songs were tweaked or developed based directly from their qualities (_Beyond the Bottom_ was made to suit their actual voices, instead of their characters’; the final live songs) or things learned from their previous songs (Yoppi’s Falsetto part in _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_ came from _Stella Drive_; Airi use of the tambourine for _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_ and 7 Senses), and their history working together gave them trust and room to experiment (all non-WUG anime tie-up songs; _Polaris_).\]

**Memories of Wake Up, Girls! Activities**

Our time together as WUG could be summed as us frantically doing one event after another, but this period we have right now feels much more fulfilling in so many ways. We just held our collaboration event WUGRISRUN and the kind words from our senior unit i☆Ris moved us to tears, and we felt how we’re truly surrounded by warm and supportive people each and every day. We don’t want to disappoint the support people have given us so we pour all our efforts into making the best shows: we leave out our anxieties and focus on our task as we set foot on stage; we think of the perfect setlists, practice them, and make sure we master everything there is to do for an event. You could say we’ve gotten so close, it’s like we’ve completely synced up and our teamwork went up a notch as a result. As an example, when we deliberated the setlist for the Final Live, our opinions were pretty much on the same track, we reached a decision right away.

Our Osaka stop had just wrapped up so I guess I can mention how awesome it is that we managed to do the things we want as WUG approaches its last hurrah. Whenever we meet and deliberate on what to do for a show, we have a say from the general flow of things down to practically the setlist.

**A Few Words for the Members**

Mayushii, I look up to you a lot. You write skits and scripts for our live shows and you do a whole host of other things people don’t usually do. You know how to take in everyone’s ideas and add them to your own to make things happen. You’re so cool and it makes me so jealous. Thank you for always pushing us forward.

Minami, everyone should learn a thing or two with how you manage your time. The way you navigate through your busy schedule and make it work makes you seem superhuman. You’re a bonafide professional.

Nanamin, my initial impression of you was of someone cheerful, aloof, and down-to-earth in the way you expect people from West Japan usually are. But the more I spend time with you, the more I see how earnest and dedicated you are as well. You may seem scatter-brained on the surface but beneath that, you’re someone who puts your all into everything you do.

Aichan, I always knew you’re a very funny and interesting person. I’m glad you were finally able to break out of your shell, so to speak, and show that to everyone in WUGBAN.

Kayatan, when we met during the first audition screening, I remember how you fawned over how adorable I was. But you know… All that time I was thinking how much more adorable you were. It completely made my day, though. Hehe.  

Yoppi, we get along so well that we’ve hung out more times than I can count, though you’re usually late and unreliable. (laughs) That’s why I could never wrap my head around how you’re such a responsible leader on stage. You know how I am, I don’t really open to people unless we’re close but you did well breaking past that. Thank you for being my friend and for always managing to make me laugh.

\[Anecdotes and interviews describe Miyu as a quick study and she would take any chance to learn anything, even if she fails at it. Regarding her comment about Mayu, she did mention in the blog about how she looks up to her (when Mayu started writing for events) as someone who is also multi-talented, though in her case, her interests directly inspire her to learn them—voice work because of anime (she initially auditioned on a whim); guitar because of K-ON!; gaming, especially shoot-em-ups, due of Touhou which inspired her to try and program a shoot-em-up in Unity by herself; DJ-ing because of her love of music, especially anisong.  
  
As for Kaya and Miyu, they first met during the initial screening. According to Miyu’s recollection, she was practicing her singing when Kaya approached her, saying that her voice sounds cute. She looked up, “saw an angel”, later learned she was much older than her, and they became fast friends before getting separated, hoping that they’ll see each other again at the end.\] 

**Final Live**

Knowing that the show is just around the corner makes me feel sad in large part because we might never get to perform our songs anymore as the seven of us. But this is our moment to show how much we’ve grown and to get everyone excited for what comes next.

But putting that aside, all I’m thinking right now is making our final show a huge success. The girls would always bring up how much I cried back then, but they were born from frustration and regret more than anything else. This time, I don’t want to cry for those reasons. I’ll only allow myself to cry once I’m happy and satisfied enough. (laughs)

We’re on that stage thanks to our fans so I want them to have a show that completely blows past their expectations. I want them to feel proud for supporting us, so they can show everyone why these girls are the best there is and the best there ever will be.
