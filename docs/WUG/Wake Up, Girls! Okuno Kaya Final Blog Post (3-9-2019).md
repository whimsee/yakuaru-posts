Konbanwug.

This is Okuno Kaya.

Haaaa… Our Parade of Memories at SSA… was amazing!

I was so broken up yesterday but also fulfilled in a lot of ways. It felt as if things have finally come to a close...

As the saying goes, all things must eventually come to an end. Just as middle school awaits once you graduate from grade school, _Wake Up, Girls!_ would also have to end to usher in new beginnings.

Keeping things as they are is important too but it’s never easy to tell if it would have been better instead for things to end in order to move forward. No one really knows for sure if either leads to a better future.

Actually, I’m still at a loss at what to say. But I want to believe that the future waiting for us is the better one. Or rather, I’ll make sure of it so that the six years we shared weren’t in vain.

But you know what I feel right now… I still can’t help but think about us holding an event next week. lol

_I guess it hasn’t sunk in yet?_  
_I’m just avoiding reality again._  
_… Yesterday felt so real though._

_Maybe the girls are feeling the same way too… Maybe I should read their posts._ 

_I wonder what our fans are feeling right now?_

A concert all to our own at the Saitama Super Arena... It didn’t feel real at all right up until we got on stage. I heard the opening video followed by _Tachiagare_’s intro as we were being lifted where I saw a brimming panorama of lights welcoming us.

I was so happy. My mind went like, “Waaa, it’s real!!” as I teared up. I couldn’t contain my excitement, so much that my heart was pounding.

Thank you.  
Thank you for coming to see us.  
Thank you.

What’s great is that we’ll be able to relive those memories whenever we want! I hope you do so that what happened there will continue to live on in our hearts.

The struggles we overcame because it was the seven of us

The things I strove for while staying true to myself

And the sight our fans showed us

I will cherish each and every single one of them.

Thank you.

_I wonder… what will become of me starting tomorrow?_  
_Whatever the future brings, I’ll make sure it’s meant for me. Hopefully._
