**\-- First off, I would like to know how Wake Up, May'n! came to be.**  

![](/images/5985f7a57899c.jpg)

May'n: I was honestly surprised. It all began with the Nendroid 10th Anniversary live in 2016. I watched them perform on stage and I was so captivated, I immediately went on twitter to vent out my feelings and decided to binge the entire anime. Since then, I became a fan. I told their staff how much I like them and asked if I could perform with them which lead to a one-off collaboration in Anime Jam 2016. It was well received, which lead to the unit being a reality.  

**\-- Was it surprising because you came to them more as a fan than a fellow artist?**  

May'n: Yeah. I'm just a fan, after all. (laughs)  

\=====================

**\*Tweets at the time\* \[part of the article -- Personal TL\]**  

> I just saw WUG at the Nendroid Anniversary live and wow. Should I watch the anime? I dunno why it starts with a movie but when I looked it up, the order seems to be Shichinin - TV Series - Seishun - Beyond. I can't stop humming their songs. Konbanwug.

> Got it! So the first movie is kinda like an Ep 0! Thanks! I've only listened to their songs before but it's a revelation seeing them live... They're adorable but I can see they definitely worked hard to shine so brightly...

\[[Festa 2016 was also on the same day, which she also attended](https://ameblo.jp/mayn-blog/entry-12227792797.html)\]  

\=====================  

**\-- (to Miyu and Nanami) Have you seen her tweets?**  

![](/images/5985f7a57eaff.jpg)

Takagi Miyu (Miyu): We couldn't believe our eyes! We were like, "Is this really her!?" (laughs)  

Yamashita Nanami (Nanami): It was crazy that she took time off her busy schedule and binged the entire series. (laughs)  

**\-- (laughs) If I may ask, May'n-san, aren’t you a fan of the group as a whole instead of having a favorite member?**  

May'n: People often tell me that but I think of it as loving each member equally!  

**\-- So it’s better to say you're a fan of each of them?**  

May'n: Yeah. I felt something when I first saw them on stage. They were drenched in sweat but each of them was radiating so much passion and intensity, and their fans were equally so. It got me curious so I decided to watch the anime. From there, my impression grew from a curiosity into something much more, so much that I wanted to collaborate with them because I knew it was going to be worth it.  

**\-- (to Nanami and Miyu) Well, what do you think?**  

![](/images/5985f7a57667d.jpg)

Nanami: Aww... I'm so happy! It makes all that sweating worth it. (laughs)  

Miyu: I have to say though, we were sweating more than usual that day. (laughs)  

May'n: You were!? (laughs)  

Nanami: We have a lot of outfits with long sleeves and it can get quite hot.  

Miyu: In true WUG fashion, we often wear warm outfits like Shoujo Koukyoukyoku's during summer, but for winter we tend to wear Beyond the Bottom's outfit, which is white and made of thin fabric. (laughs)  

**\-- (to WUG) Can you tell me how AnimeJAM's collaboration went for you?**  

Miyu: It goes without saying that we already knew who May'n was before we debuted. She has this image of a super cool anisong artist, so we couldn't contain our excitement when we heard her through our earpieces.  

Nanami: Right! It was surreal!  

Miyu: I remember Mayushii \[Yoshioka Mayu\] saying, "Wait. Crazy... May'n-chan’s singing with me on my solo part!" (laughs)  

May'n: Yeah! I also wanted to sing that part and realized it was Mayushii's solo. (laughs)  

**\-- (to May'n) and how was** **_Tachiagare_****?**  

May'n: It made me realize how capable WUG is because singing while doing their choreography is not an easy feat. But I hung in there because I love them so much and I want to show them my "Tachiagare!". It wouldn't make for a good collaboration if I couldn't keep up with them so I practiced really hard on my free time.  

Miyu: She told us she memorized most of the steps before our rehearsals and she mastered all of them pretty quickly.  

Nanami: Yeah. Our rehearsals went smoothly and without any issue.  

**\-- Never underestimate a WUGner when they get serious. (laughs) Now that you've worked together, did it change your impression about each other?**  

Nanami: We decided to wear our Bokura no Frontier outfit for our AnimeJAM collaboration because we think it’s a perfect fit for May'n-chan. She usually carries a cool and stoic image, but I was glad when I learned that she's actually really kind and friendly in-person.  

Miyu: Her stage outfits usually involve tank tops and shorts, which project a certain coolness to it, so it was a surprise seeing her in a skirt. She was so cute. Dangerously so. (laughs)  

May'n: Thank you for the kind words. (laughs)  

**\-- How about you and WUG, May'n? Did your impression about them change?**  

May'n: Perhaps but it's probably much better to say that they reconfirmed my initial impressions. I feel like they're a group who is given a lot of freedom to do what they want. But what charmed me about them is that even during breaks, they would spend it practicing.

**\-- I see. Now that we have this opportunity, can you tell me your favorite WUG song?**  

May'n: It would be _Beyond the Bottom_ because that's where I fell in love with them. Who wouldn't?! The song itself is beautiful. They look so majestic in those white dresses as they wear serious expressions and sing and dance with all their heart, hair flying every which way, as if their life depended on it.  

**\-- It looks so dramatic when they perform it on stage.**  

May'n: That's it! I immediately got taken in by it which lead to me binging the entire anime.  

Nanami: Wow... I'm so happy to hear that our hard work paid off.  

**\-- How about you two? What's your favorite May'n song?**  

Miyu: Mine’s _Diamond Crevasse_!  

Nanami: Hey, I was about to say that!  

Miyu: (laughs) I like all her songs but I got intense goosebumps when I heard it at Aniuta Live 2017. It hit me right at my soul and I almost cried. (laughs)  

Nanami: Right. That performance was unforgettable. It was both breathtaking and tear-jerking, and it made wonder how she could conjure such powerful emotions. We can only hope to put out that kind of performance on stage.  

May'n: Thank you so much!  

Miyu: I like _Belief_, as well. It's an awesome song!  

Nanami: It powers out so much feeling!  

Miyu: It’s off the scale!  

Nanami: Right, right.  

_(everyone laughs)_  

Miyu: She's adorable as well on her cute songs.  

May'n: You mean it? (laughs) Thanks.  

**One in a Billion's theme of "a precious once-in-a-lifetime encounter"**

* * *

**\-- Moving on, what can you say about _One in a Billion_****?**  

May'n: It's a song that embodies _Restaurant to Another World_ (Isekai Shokudō)’s, theme of "a precious once-in-a-lifetime encounter". It's a song that came about because of my encounter with WUG, and it's filled with new ideas that make it a fun song.  

Nanami: As the anime's opening song, it pulls ideas from it like the lyrics containing words like "Peko Peko" \[famished\]. I think those cute "spicy" parts give it a unique hook.  

Miyu: It's a really engaging song and like May'n-chan said, it's a song that wouldn't have happened if we didn't cross paths. What I like about it is that it’s arranged differently. The song starts with May'n-chan's solo before it goes to us singing individual parts then all of us singing together for the next set of verses.  

**\-- So you could say it's a blending of concepts between May'n-san and WUG?**  

Myu: Yeah. It’s that point I want everyone to take note of.  

**\-- (to Nanamin and May’n) How about for you?**  

Nanami: The lyrics are so uplifting, unlike our usual songs which can be pretty dark and ominous. (laughs)  

May'n: Surprisingly so. (laughs)  

Nanami: That's what immediately jumped out at me when I first read them.  

May'n: Me too. (laughs)  

Miyu: Me three! (laughs)

May'n: That said, it brings out the cute side of WUG. I had a lot of fun singing it because I also don't have songs like it.  

**\-- It's funny to think that your \[WUG and May’n\] songs have a reputation for being dark and serious. (laughs)**  

May'n: It's only the lyrics, though. (laughs)  

**\-- Going back, what do you think are the highlights in _One in a Billion_****?**  

Miyu: I think what's fun about the song is that it starts out slow then explodes as it picks up the tempo and turns into a frantic melody.  

Nanami: I like the insert lines before every verse that go “Fyu!”, “Jon!”, “Mix!”, “Cha!”. I think the audience can join in those parts and make the performance more exciting.  

May'n: The lyrics are full of food references. Just like the line  “Sukikiraishiteicha mottainai yo ne“ \[It won’t hurt to be less picky\], they give a message that food is an essential part of one's life.  I also think there will be WUG fans who will know of me through this, so I hope they find their encounter with me with the same joy and excitement I felt when I met WUG.  

**\-- (To Miyu and Nanami) Since you got the opportunity to sing it during the Osaka stop of your tour, how did it go?**  

Nanami: It was our first time performing it on stage, so we were both curious and excited about how the audience would react!  

Miyu: They were so into it!  

Nanami: I sang the second part feeling relieved with the reception. (laughs)  

May'n: The choreography itself already looked hard enough.  

Miyu: It was and the vocal key was higher than usual.  

Nanami: And it came after _Koi de Ai de Boukun desu_ ...  

May'n: Wow! That would have been a lot of dancing!  

Nanami: It was! Then after that was Miyu's character song...  

Miyu: It was a rough day. (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**\-- How was the shoot for the music video, May'n-san?**  

May'n: I'm used to working with backup dancers where we stay in static formation with me at the center, so being in a dynamic one was difficult. Normally, the intervals are spaced by .5 units, as in .5 to 1.0. But for WUG it was .25 units, which made little sense to me. (laughs) Actually, I couldn’t see the marks well and I always felt like I was about to bump into someone.  

(Article's explanation: In a formation, the "center mark" is designated the number 0 and it grows to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc. as it expands. The shorter the interval, the more complicated the formation.)  

Nanami: It was pretty cramped.  

Miyu: And there are so many patterns to keep in mind.  

Nanami: The song is arranged differently, too. Our choreographer, SATOMI, really spent time with us to polish and perfect it.  

**\-- I see. May’n-san, were you able to understand WUG's appeal with that experience?**  

May'n: Yes. I feel that their dance formations are what really sets them apart from others. I always get mesmerized by it and I learned how hard it is to do now that I have the experience of being part of it.  

**\-- Now that you mention it, did you encounter any difficulties during the shoot?**  

Miyu: The choreography involving the rolling pins took some time to get right because we just mastered it on the day of the shoot.

**\-- Ah, it’s that scene where you work the dough, right? So you memorized it on the day?**  

May’n: Yeah. We did it during breaks between shots.  

Nanami: We each had our own solo cuts so we spent our free time rehearsing the steps on our own.  

May’n: Everyone else memorized the steps so quickly so I always ended up asking one of them to run through it for me again. (laughs) We made more than a few mistakes during the actual shoot so I’m glad the final version looks solid.  

**\-- Do you recommend any must-see portions in the music video?**  

Nanami: This might not be easy to spot but it’s in the scene where the boy enters the restaurant and the girls notice him coming in. I was supposed to act like I was about to trip while carrying plates. Making it look natural was difficult though so I ended up just looking confused. (laughs)  

Miyu: (laughs) For me, it was during the sandwich making shots. Each of us tried to look as if we’re attacking the screen while wielding kitchen utensils but I couldn’t pick one so someone suggested I use my hands instead. (laughs) I really wanted to wield something big, though. (laughs)  

May’n: So that’s why you looked so wound up!  

**\-- It’s like you wanted to cut someone in half. (laughs)**  

Miyu: You could say that. (laughs)  

May’n: And here I was thinking you have such beautiful hands. (laughs) For me, we shot a lot of solo cuts so I want to point to those. WUGners might be glad to see us trying our hardest to entice them to patronize our services. (laughs)  

**\-- I can see why. You all look so cute.**  

May’n: Whenever I watched the other takes from the sidelines, I couldn't help myself thinking how cute and cool they looked!  

**\-- And by “cool” do you mean Yoshioka Mayu-san? (laughs)**

May’n: Yup. (laughs)  

Nanami: Everyone watched whenever her turn comes. (laughs)  

Miyu: And Kaya would be the most excited and squeal in surprise. (laughs)  

**\-- It sounds so much like your group that you’re fans of each other. (laughs)**  

Miyu: That’s because we’re all having so much fun. (laughs)  

**What the future holds for WUM**

* * *

**\-- For this single, not only do you have a music video but also a dance video shot at multiple angles. Is there anything you can say about them?**  

Miyu: I think people would enjoy the different camera angles.  

PR Manager: We decided to release two videos with the dance version showcasing the entire choreography, which I think fans are looking forward to.  

**\-- I certainly would. I always wanted to see what the formation looks like without the scenes.**  

Miyu: It’s our first time doing something like this so come check it out.  

Nanami: We did our best to do it perfectly so make sure to give it a watch!  

Miyu: May’n-chan worked hard trying to stay in formation with us!  

May’n: I sure did! (laughs) You don’t usually see a group of 8 performing so I hope a lot of people get to watch it.  

**\-- Moving on, another song, _Ou-sama no Cadenza_** **will come with the single. What kind of song is it?**  

Miyu: It’s more slow-paced compared to _One in a Billion_. It has a whimsical feel to it especially at the start where we mimicked the fanfare of trumpets (Pa Pa Pa~)  

Nanami: It’s very catchy.  

May’n: It certainly has a more mature playfulness to it.  

**\-- It feels different from your other songs.**  

May’n: It is for me. How about for you two?  

Miyu: Yeah. It’s new to us.  

May’n: The lyrics talk about a bare-naked king but it only alludes to it for most of the song and it feels more interesting that way. But just like _One in a Billion_, the lyrics also carry a peculiar excited energy that will mean differently from person to person.  

**\-- I see. I sounds like a well-thought-out song.**  

Miyu: It very profound, I really like that about it.  

**\-- What are its highlights?**  

May’n: The fanfare at the beginning is certainly cute. Compared to _One in a Billion_, we sound so relaxed singing it. Actually, it was funny watching their manager direct each of them differently for that part. Some were instructed to sound more child-like, some more mature, and some more silly. (laughs)  

**\-- Really? (laughs) Now I’m curious who those members were.**  

Miyu: I wasn’t supposed to be part of it at first but when I learned it was going to be that, I wanted in.  

**\-- Ah.**  

Miyu: So I also want to listen closely to it because I don’t have any idea about how everyone else was directed.  

May’n: _One in a Billion_ is the kind of song you’d sing at a concert, but _Ou-sama no Cadenza_ has a different appeal to it because I want everyone to know that we can sing in different styles, that we still have more to offer. Releasing just one single would be wasted potential so I want this to make an impression.  

**\-- I certainly want to see more of WUM. Any future plans for the unit?**  

Nanami: I want to work with May’n-chan and voice a character in an anime!  

May’n: Huh? Can I do that for _Shin Shou_!? (laughs)  

Miyu: Hmm… That I want to see!  

Nanami: Seeing 2D May’n-chan meeting the girls would be a treat. (laughs)  

\[This a reference to Twinkle in a way since the members of the unit, Anna and Karina, resemble their voice actresses, Tomatsu Haruka and Hanazawa Kana\]  

**\-- You could say they finally get to meet one of their idols. (laughs)**  

Miyu: (laughs) I want to do a WUM live show! Something more than the free show we’ll be holding for the release.  

**\-- Which will be on August 9. Can you say anything about it?**  

May’n: It’s in the middle of the week but it’s a rare opportunity to see an 8-member unit perform on stage so I encourage everyone to come.  

Miyu: It will be our first time performing live as WUM so I hope the audience will enjoy it.  

Nanami: We showcased the 7-member version during the tour but I’m sure it’ll be different with May’n. So even if you’ve seen it there, I guarantee it won’t be the same. See you there.  

**\-- Thank you. Let’s switch topics to food. What’s your favorite dish?**  

May’n: (laughs) This is completely unrelated to _Restaurant to Another World_ but I’m a big fan of taiyaki. So much that I’ve even had [articles made about it](https://webnewtype.com/special/mayn/). (laughs) Taiyaki is the quintessential Japanese confection so I want even otherworldly beings to experience it.  

Miyu: I was about to say meat… but that wouldn’t be right. Next time I go for yakiniku, I’m ordering codfish! (Laughs)  

May’n: Oh… Me too! I love them!  

Miyu: Really? Mm too! Codfish and Yukhoe (Korean dish)!  

May’n: Right. I’d take that too!  

**\-- You two sound so excited. (laughs)**  

Nanami: I’m a big fan of Japanese omelette rice.  

May’n: Ah. I like that too!  

Nanami: The Japanese variety especially, stuffed with mushrooms and swimming in thick gravy.  

May’n: I’m an expert at making that! I’ll take you on, Nanami!  

Nanami: What!? I might get a stomachache. (laughs) The one I prefer the most is the one my grandmother made for me when I was little. She adds eggplants to it.  

**\-- Now that we’re on the topic, I didn’t know you cook, May’n-san.**  

May’n: I cook a lot for myself. I’m good at making omelette rice but also oyakodon (chicken and egg on rice).  They say eggs are hard to cook with but I love them.  

**\-- Ah. A true cook. I should say the same about you, Yamashita-san.**  

Nanami: You could say I cook the most out of the group. They don’t really cook so that distinction goes to me. (laughs)  

**\-- (laughs) How about you, Takagi-san?**  

Miyu: I only make Java curry. (laughs)  

Nanami: Only that!? (laughs)  

Miyu: I can also make beef potato stew with the same ingredients! I’m don’t want to cut vegetables so I just buy them ready-made and frozen and use that instead. (laughs)  

**\-- That also works. (laughs) Now, since this is also a gaming website, can you tell us what games you’ve been playing?**  

May’n: I play a bit of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on the Nintendo Switch before I go to bed. It’s really fun! It’s the one game I play the most.  

Nanami: Mario Kart!  

Miyu: It’s fun!  

May’n: I like it especially when I get to play with people online because there’s always someone to play with. I’m not good at games and it’s hard for me to get used to the controls but Mario Kart has a smart steering option, which makes it enjoyable for me. Also, I made a Mii that looks just like me who encourages me to do my best but cries when I lose, so I always try to win her smile when I play.  

**\-- Have you played Mario Kart since you were little?**  

May’n: I’ve played the series on and off over the years.  

**\-- How about you, Takagi-san?**  

Miyu: I haven’t played games lately except for 虫姫さま ふたり (_Mushihimesama_) on my phone. It’s a punishing bullet hell but nothing beats the feeling of clearing a stage. The boss battles are tough but if I take it seriously, it fun and rewarding.  

\[Miyu’s working relationship with CAVE (who made _Mushihimesama_) came gradually. She started going to their public events as a regular fan, then the next year she got invited to be part of their events, and began to host their events the next.\]  

**\-- So you’re a fan of shoot ‘em ups. How about you, Yamashita-san?**  

Nanami: I don’t really play games but I play the ones we worked on such as _八月のシンデレラナイン_ (_Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine_) and ソウルリバース ゼロ (_Soul Reverse Zero_). I can’t seem to roll their characters though, especially mine. And I’m not good at resetting if I happen to get their characters first... (laughs)  

\[Nanami is referring to a gacha game practice of uninstalling and reinstalling the game which is a way of resetting a random roll.\]  

**\-- I know what you feel. (laughs) Next topic, what do you do on your days off?**  

May’n: I go to the gym. I like to kickbox so when I have time, I usually go for one a half hour sessions.  

**\-- Looking at WUG, I think if you low kicked some of them, their legs would shatter. (laughs)**  

Miyu: (Tanaka) Minami and (Aoyama) Yoshino for sure. (laughs)  

**\-- Their legs are pretty thin.**  

Nanami: It’s been that way forever.  

**\-- (to May’n) What do you usually do during those sessions?**  

May’n: I spar with a trainer. It keeps my body moving so it clears my mind. If I did it alone, my thoughts just race.  

**\-- Have you competed in matches?**  

May’n: Not at the moment.  

**\-- Do you plan to?**  

May’n: I want to try it! (laughs)  

**\-- (laughs). How about you Takagi-san?**  

Miyu: I haven’t done it in a while but I play the drums. I started practicing it for our solo event back in March. I did the drums for my character song while the audience sang along. (laughs)  

May’n: Wow! That’s so cool!  

Miyu: I can’t sing well while playing the drums, though. (smirks) I’m still a beginner but it’s fun. My 3-hour lessons go by so fast that I get completely motivated to go for it again once it’s over.  

**\-- What do you like about the drums?**  

Miyu:  I like the intense feeling of the beats hitting me as I use my body to follow the rhythm. I find that using your entire body to make music very engaging.

\[Incidentally, Miyu is an expert at Taiko no Tatsujin\]

**\-- How about you, Yamashita-san?**  

Nanami: I throw away my stuff.  

May’n: What!?  

**\-- Do you mean to say you’re decluttering? (laughs)**  

Nanami: I wouldn’t go that far but my room gets cluttered with all sorts of stuff—Small trinkets, clothes I bought two years ago that I barely wore, that kind of stuff. I just want to throw them away so I classify them into two piles—needed and not needed—and it’s so refreshing once they’re gone. The whole process usually takes up a whole day.  

May’n: I wish I could do that...  

**\-- Are you a hoarder, by any chance?**  

May’n: My house looks like it came straight out of Don Quixote \[who is a hoarder\]. (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**\-- I’m sure there are people like that in the world.**  

May’n: I love hippos and that alone I have more than 700 plush toys of.  

Miyu: Wow!  

May’n: I also own a lot of figures. I have told me how lively my house looks, while some have said it looks like a mess and tells me to practice some restraint. (laughs)  

Miyu: I like Don Quixote-types. They seem fun. (laughs)  

**\-- Finally, can I get a message from you for our readers?**  

Nanami: At first, I felt WUM was something we didn’t deserve, that it sounded strange being close to May’n-chan and calling ourselves “Wake Up, May’n!” but now I can freely say that I’m proud of it all. We'll be having our release event soon and we will perform many songs as WUM in the free concert. It’ll be exciting and I hope to see you there.  

\[The setlist for that free show was _Tachiagare_, _Ou-sama no Cadenza_, _Heartline_, _One In A Billion_\]  

Miyu: It’s been nothing but good vibes since we met May’n-chan and, with the release event and free live happening soon, I’m excited to see you all as “Wake Up, May’n!”. We're looking forward to hearing cheers like “Ganbatte WUM-chan!” and I hope that the nickname “WUM-chan” finds its place in the hearts of our fans.  

May’n: It’s rare for me to be part of a collaborative release so when WUM first came together, I thought it was surreal. But making this happen feels just right. Who knows what will come next but I want to do more with WUM because I know we can do more. I believe this won’t just be a one-off thing so I would be grateful for your support.  

\[Since WUM became a thing, their paths crossed quite a lot that they would write about, 2016 -- AnimeJAM, Festa, Year-end party w/ Miyu and Yoppi. 2017 -- Aniuta Live, One in a Billion release event, Anisama, AnimeJAM, May’n’s birthday live as special guest, 4th tour’s final stop (afternoon show) as encore special guest [(Link - May'n's blog post)](https://ameblo.jp/mayn-blog/entry-12311398815.html). 2018 - Green Leaves Fes's afternoon show.\]
