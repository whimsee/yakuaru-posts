These interview sections were taken from the solo event documentary videos from WUGLOVE 2018 Solo Event URA. They’re exclusive fan club content and while I am averse to working on things like that, the answers are quite interesting, especially that it touches upon the disband announcement on June 15, 2018.

I figured that a good compromise is to just adapt it into a text article format. It won’t read the exact same way as if you watched the videos themselves but it should still get the message across a similar manner.

This will be presented in blog order starting from Mayu. Every interview comes in two parts. The first part was taken on the day of their respective solo event in March, the next was taken five months later, roughly after their appearance in Animelo Summer Live 2018.

**An Early Start In Acting**

I joined a theater company when I was four, though it took about a year until I started doing shows. My mom must have thought I was strange so she decided that for me so I could get used to working in groups. I was still in kindergarten at the time and the purpose wasn’t necessarily for me to learn acting. Rather, the point was for me to learn how to interact in those workshop environments.

That’s how it started but surprisingly, I just kept at it. I eventually got involved in doing productions and before I knew it, it became something that I wanted to take seriously.

**Inspiration To Audition For _Wake Up, Girls!_**

Once I entered high school, I began to consider my options: Whether to go to college while acting on the side, or to pursue acting full-time, among other things.

I just did my first stage play around that time and until then, I was always told that theater wasn’t for me. They’d say that my acting was better suited for the screen instead of the stage so I wasn't fond of it for a long time. But that stage play was an unexpected opportunity, where I got glowing compliments on my acting and got me to begin enjoying it in earnest.

I was in that place in my life, where I realized that I end up enjoying things I dislike once I gave them a shot, that I discovered the WUG audition and decided to try out.

\[According to JP Wikipedia, she appeared in two stage shows in 2012. _Natsuyasumi da yo! Seishun Tantei_ where she was an ensemble swimming club member and _Lucky Star on Stage_ where she starred as Minegishi Ayano\]

**Distaste Toward Idols**

I used to despise idols. It hated them so much that I couldn’t imagine myself as one. I mean, it’s just ridiculous how lively they get in front of a crowd, or so I thought.

Once I became intimately familiar with it though.... I realized that “Idols” are individuals who have the power to bring a smile to people’s faces. Being an idol isn’t just about being cute. It’s also about bringing out your best qualities into your performances and using that energy to make people smile.

Seeing them in that light, I gained a profound respect for them and I wouldn’t have come to that conclusion if I never tried being one.

**Loving Things Previously Hated \[Continues directly from the previous line\]**

I can say the same for singing. I used to hate doing it too, especially in front of an audience. But without a doubt, WUG is what got me to love singing as much as I do now.

It’s fulfilling when you get to see the expressions of each and every face in the audience and know that your voice has reached them. Live shows give you that direct link with the audience. You can express your feelings in real-time which brings out a shared positive experience that is unlike any other.

**Challenge Everything**

Right now, I want to pour all my energy into everything that comes my way, and I don’t want to miss any opportunity. I want to be someone who is willing to do anything and is capable of doing everything. It’s a mindset I’ve always held. I don’t want anything holding me back because I fear that would be it for me once that happens.

But most of all, I do it for the people who appreciate what I do. Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) for instance, she asked me to write something for her solo event, which I did. To paraphrase her, she said, “There’s a sense of humor in your writing that is easily relatable to anyone. It’s not something you usually see in a stage play or a reading drama, and that’s what I like about it.”

I was very grateful to hear that since the request came from a fellow member who I’ve worked with for years, someone who I can easily bounce ideas with, and is willing to let me showcase my skills for her solo event. There was absolutely no way I could refuse.

\[Mayu described in her weekly MyCloset column that while she dabbles in many things—Writing, singing, dancing, acting, and as of the time of writing, VJ-ing—for all sorts of reasons, the common motivator for her to continue doing them is when people recognize her efforts and appreciate what she can do with it.\]

**Solo Event Concept**

My concept last year was to sing my character songs as a gesture of gratitude for the roles I’ve portrayed over the years. This time though, I want to switch things up and fill it entirely with my own ideas… and I’m dying of nerves. (laughs)

Since it's going to be two shows, I'm aiming to make each of them unique because I want to emphasize how I do live shows. I'm a huge fan of rock music so the afternoon show will be full of songs meant to hype up the crowd, while the evening show is focused on ballads. Whichever show they decide to go, I made careful considerations to make sure it’s worth it.

\[Solo live Setlist (Source: Mayu’s blog post that week + edits for clarity)  
  
**Afternoon (Rock-focused)**  
**M01：** GloriA | Mayu Yoshioka; **M02：** Hacking to the Gate | Kanako Ito; **M03：** IGNITE | Eir Aoi; **M04：** adrenaline!! | TrySail; **M05：** 極限Dreamer | SCREEN mode; **M06：** ROCK-mode | LiSA; **M07：** メリッサ |  Porno Graffitti; **M08：** ブルーバード |  Ikimono-gakari; **M09：** JOINT |  Mami Kawada; **M10：** 七色シンフォニー | Coalamode.; **M11：** てがみ | Mayu Yoshioka; **M12：** sweet sweet place | Mayu Yoshioka

Additionally, _sweet sweet place_ was a surprise solo rock song that was only revealed that day. It was made with the same people and envisioned as a complementary ending theme to _GloriA_’s opening vibe. It was performed in a few more live venues—in her solo activities, some WUG events and tour stops—but is yet to have a commercial CD release.\]

**Sentiments Toward _Wake Up, Girls_****!**

WUG isn’t just your regular idol unit. It’s unique. Incomparable, even, I’ve always called it. And if it’s missing even a single member, it won’t be WUG anymore.

Who we are now—Takagi, Aoyama, Okuno, Eino, Yamashita, Tanaka, and me, Yoshioka—The seven of us are _Wake Up, Girls!_ and this is where we belong.  Replace, remove any of us, or even add to our number… and it will be something completely different.

**5 Months Later…**

[**Looking Back At The Solo Event**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12359766842.html)

That day was quite special. We had a moment of silence to prepare ourselves for what was going to be an intense day.

**The Day Of The Disband Announcement**

We decided when exactly the announcement would drop. I barely checked my phone when the time came but once I did, I spent the rest of the day reading what people felt.

There were reactions from people who only knew about us in passing. Old friends, who I never realized had been supporting us, messaged me through LINE. I even received messages from peers who I thought had already forgotten about me.

I felt apologetic but happy deep down. It gave me the push I needed to see things through until the end.

**Recent Thoughts**

It hit me again how the name “Wake Up, Girls!” had found its place in a lot of people. The fact that we’re disbanding really struck a chord and people had been talking about it. Who can say if this is for the best but I fully came to realize just how big WUG had gotten over the years.

I’m taking it a lot more in a positive way than otherwise. I want to make more people smile than ever before. I used to firmly believe that we should feel the most broken up about it, but now I’ve received so much support from everyone that from here on, I want us to be that kind of supportive presence to them as well.

**Sentiments Toward The Members**

I’ll always be grateful to them. I’ve opened myself to them more times than I can remember. They’re the six people in my life that I’ve felt the most fortunate meeting because I changed the most thanks to them… Now I feel like crying. (laughs) It feels strange.

**What Comes Next**

I’m not going to cry. (laughs) I won’t cry.

I don’t usually cry but somehow I’ve cried quite a lot, like in Anisama (Animelo Summer Live)... It surprised even me that I could cry. Those tears, though, aren’t really tears of sadness. They’re tears of gratitude and happiness. It’s my way of saying thank you for being there for us and that I’ll have to step it up even more to deserve that support. I was grateful beyond words, that time. (laughs) For the girls, our fans, the staff. Everyone. I promise not to disappoint those who believe that I can do anything.

I don’t want WUG to be forgotten and my love for Tohoku is genuine so I want to continue doing what I can to help and I’ll do my best to be someone who is capable of answering the support I’ve gotten from everyone.

\[Mayu used to recall an anecdote about their first few shows where everyone on stage was in tears except her. She said on the mic, unwittingly she would later add, that she's not going to cry until WUG has well and truly ended.\]

**Disaster As The Reason To Change**

I used to believe that I was being the ideal student in my own way. (laughs) I’d aim for the easiest possible goal, like getting perfect attendance, which actually got me an award in high school.

Back then, there would be occasions where I’d be completely alone. It was very tough to deal with but I never skipped school because I would feel that I’d given up if I did, and I always hated losing. So I motivated myself to keep attending no matter what. It wasn't because I prioritize my studies, though I also did my best there. I simply wanted to get perfect attendance and that ended up becoming my goal.

Making everyone happy is difficult. Or rather, the actual act of realizing your ideas to make that happen is a lot easier said than done. Still, it was something I always wanted to do and what finally pushed me to pursue it was the Tohoku Earthquake Disaster and passing the audition for _Wake Up, Girls!_ opened up more possibilities for me.

**What Is WUG To You?**

That’s a difficult question to answer but I can say that WUG is the catalyst that motivated me to turn my ideas into reality. WUG started everything for me. It got me to take that first step into achieving things I used to feel afraid of attempting. It taught me all sorts of experiences. I learned to accept myself. It may have only been five short years but it’s already an irreplaceable part of my life.

**The Importance Of Voicing Your Own Opinions**

Back then, I used to defer to other people’s opinions all the time. I’d be passive and let their ideas take precedence over mine, for example. But WUG taught me that there are things I’m willing to fight for.

It’s because I love WUG so much that it happens but we all feel the same way in that regard. We all have things we’re not willing to give up on so, as you would expect, we get into arguments. But as arguments go, there’s a reason why we get into them—we share the same love for WUG, our music, and our fans.

I rarely experienced that kind of environment until then. In every discussion, no one is entirely right. We have to take in each perspective and understand where they’re coming from until we figure something out. It’s important to give each opinion their fair share because we might realize things that never crossed our minds. And it’s just as important to dig deep within ourselves and explore why we came across that idea in the first place.

I gained that mindset thanks to WUG.

**Setlist Considerations**

More often than not, our setlists revolve around a message that we want to convey. For example, if we do a show in Tohoku, we might want to express our desire to bring joy to the people there. That sentiment becomes the core concept of the setlist which we would then flesh out and decide which songs get included and in what order. Of course, there’s more to it; all sorts of things come into consideration such as how the songs flow into the next and how that impacts the overall mood.

We’re a group of seven, so it’s no surprise that we get into disagreements. We each care about different things and it’s not unlikely that a song one member wants to close out the show with might be in a different place for another. So we always talk things through and go over their reasoning until we agree on a decision. What comes out of it is a setlist that everyone strongly believes in.

A setlist isn’t worth doing if there’s no personal investment in it. That’s why we all have our own reasons in deciding a certain setlist and why I can say that we’ve never had one that was meaningless. The same goes for our live shows; it always starts from a theme or a message we want to express.

Actually, people might not have noticed this so I encourage them to rewatch our shows because they might realize that the song order also communicates a message. I would greatly appreciate it if they take that opportunity to unravel its meaning.

\[Over time, the girls were gradually allowed to design their own setlists. It started from smaller live shows (three song setlists) and the 2nd Live tour (where they started getting involved in designing the tour itself) to bigger events (notably, Anisong World Matsuri -- Super Kawaii Live in LA and 10th Anniversary Nendroid Live) and eventually the 4th Live Tour (entirely by Airi and Mayu), Final Tour (in various degrees in each part and stop) and SSA FInal Live (primarily by all members)\]

_(Staff asks her which song is the hardest to place in a setlist)_

(laughs) for WUG songs in particular? There’s a lot.

_(Staff asks her to name just one)_

Personally... it would have to be _Beyond the Bottom_. A lot of our friends and fans love that song, and we share the sentiment even more. It carries a lot of meaning but it’s also deeply profound and us singing it always shines a grand brilliance to it.

At its core though, it’s a mid-tempo ballad. You don’t usually think of those songs hyping up an audience so while it’s full of things we want to impart to them, it’s always a tough call finding a place for it in the setlist. And it can’t be the finale because we always want to end our shows with everyone feeling energized.

So it might come as a surprise but it's _Beyond the Bottom_. Maybe that’s one way to enjoy rewatching our shows though, finding out where it falls in the setlist… And I have to say, all our songs are pretty amazing.

**5 Months Later**

**[Looking Back At The Solo Event](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12361877263.html)**

When we went to Iwaki City to hold a charity live show, we got in a van with the staff and drove around Ishinomaki, which was something we had been looking forward to doing. It was the first time we actually took the time to visit places in Tohoku and experience how things really were with our own senses.

The impression I got really stuck with me. It reminded me that there are still so many things we need to do, things that I personally want to lend a hand in, and I felt fortunate that I was able to bring those sentiments to our solo event tour.

**The Day of the Disband Announcement**

I was so anxious that day, so much that I could barely keep myself together thirty minutes before it was to be announced. I remember Kaya messaging me through LINE three minutes before that saying “It’s time” and when it finally came, my heart was pounding like crazy and I was too anxious to check my phone and see how people reacted to it.

I eventually did after some time and I strongly empathized with a lot of the sadness people were expressing. But once the initial shock passed, an overwhelming amount of well-wishes and positive sentiments came with it, some of which I never expected we would ever get.

I honestly thought the announcement would only make people sad but everyone was so positive and optimistic for us. I was so glad because I even saw messages that went like, “It doesn’t matter. I’ll keep supporting them anyway.”

**WUG’s Current Morale**

I can imagine our fans are still trying to wrap their heads around it and are probably concerned if things have become awkward between us or if we’re feeling depressed overall. But it was as if nothing had changed after the announcement and we still have our usual fun goofing off and chatting in the dressing room as it had always been.

**A Change In Perspective**

I went through a period of uncertainty in the middle of our Tohoku Solo Live Tour. I was at a low point, having negative thoughts and feeling frustrated because there were still so many things I wanted to do. But I eventually turned it around as I started thinking of things I can still do and ideas I want to try even after we disband, then I just kept at it until I started feeling very optimistic.

**What Comes Next**

I’m going to pour all my efforts into realizing the ideas I have in mind as I move forward in the path I’ve chosen. I’m trying to think of ways for all of us to see each other again so I ask our fans not to worry and to eagerly look forward to it.

The unit, _Wake Up, Girls!_, is disbanding but various aspects of the franchise will continue to exist, and I want to continue devoting my energy to them. There’s still a lot I aim to accomplish and I hope I can do lots of activities that can communicate the strong feelings I have for Tohoku.

**Desire To Become A Voice Actress**

For our grade school graduation ceremony, they had us answer a question before we could accept our diploma: “Who do you want to be when you grow up?”

At the time, I hadn’t been thinking about my future seriously. My classmates had big dreams like becoming a soccer athlete or a manga artist but all I wanted was to work at a bakery. I even wrote in our yearbook that I dreamed of becoming a chocolatier because I love chocolate, so that’s what I answered for our rehearsal. But after hearing everyone else’s, I came to realize how trivial that dream was. So I decided to take it seriously and thought of a more appropriate one.

I’ve already known for some time that you can have a career out of voice acting and it seemed like the perfect fit for me, so on the morning of the ceremony, I told my mom that I want to be a voice actress instead. She said it was fine as long as I think of a good reason for it, to which I decided right then and there, “I want to be in an anime.”

\[She recalled what happened next in other interviews and radio shows. She stood in front of everyone and loudly proclaimed that she will become a voice actress.\]

**Solo Event Concept**

_(Staff asks about the concept behind the setlist)_

Since there’s going to be an afternoon show and an evening show, I decided to make different setlists for both, each with WUG elements in them and would also reflect who I am and my talents.

_(Staff asks what her talent is)_

It would have to be… Doing impersonations, I guess? (laughs)

Everyone loves it when I do impersonations of the girls so I thought of including that as well.

**Have You Always Enjoyed Standing Out?**

I like standing out but I’m not fond of being the center of attention. (laughs) I know. It sounds like I’m contradicting myself. I really enjoy expressing myself and I’m very much attracted to the idea of projecting as someone else, so I feel that the reason why I can’t cut it as a regular actress or focus on theater is… Well, I don’t want people seeing me as I am.

I love acting but I do it not to bring attention to myself as Tanaka Minami. That’s why I thought being a voice actress would be the perfect fit for me at the time.

**Auditioning For WUG**

I didn’t want to go to college because I was intent on becoming a voice actress. I even went so far and said that I was prepared to enroll at a training academy or a vocational school so I could be one. Whenever I told people that though I often got scolded for being irresponsible and I didn’t take it too well. (laughs)

So I decided to take things into my own hands and try out for an audition. I dug around and I think summer had just started when I applied for WUG. I just wanted to try and see how far I could get with my skills so I never imagined I would pass.

\[To clarify, the scoldings often came from her teachers during career and parent-teacher meetings who insisted that she should think of her future seriously. Her family was very supportive, accepted her decision right from the start without any issue, and even prepared the dress for her acceptance ceremony as best newcomer in the 11th Seiyu Awards.  
  
While she often mentioned in blogs and interviews that she would have become a voice actress eventually come hell or high water, she always followed it up by saying that WUG is precious to her because it made her who she is now and that any other path would have resulted into a different version of her.\]

**If The World Were To End Tomorrow?**

If you put it that way, I have to say I don’t actually have that many desires in life. That’s how our family is, really. We don’t want for much, even material possessions. (laughs)

We’re still using the same hair dryer that we had since I was born. Sometimes I even question why that is but everyone says it still works. (laughs) We’ve been using it forever and we just couldn’t replace it anymore.

_(laughter in room)_

There are other things like that too, stuff from back then that we’re still using, like the toaster my parents bought a little after I was born. It’s been there for as long as I remember.

_(Sudden cut -- to get back on topic)_

I would go to the sea. A beautiful one. I’d want it to be the last thing I ever see. (laughs) My dad loves the sea, that’s why he had “海” \[Kanji for “sea”\] as part of my name. You could say it brings a sense of calm. Whenever our family goes out for the first shrine visit of the year, we usually choose to go to the sea instead.

I love the sea. I love the sound. The magnificent view. That’s why I’d go to one.

**Feelings Toward The Fans**

Every once in a while I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that I’m actually a voice actress. So knowing that people are out there supporting me and that they’re just as passionate even in my other projects… It’s very heartwarming. It makes me believe that perhaps they truly believe in me.

**What Is Wake Up, Girls To You?**

Hmm… How should I put it… It’s an irreplaceable part of me. Without a doubt, I won’t be who I am right now without WUG.

I’m grateful for all the things we’ve done. I grew from a student who barely knew anything into a sensible adult who is very conscious about the world around me. By which I mean, I learned so much aside from the lessons we took for singing, dancing, and voice acting, all of which are being put into good use.

So when I work on other projects and hear my colleagues complain how difficult the dance is, I can’t help but snicker to myself and compare how it is in WUG. I started thinking that way because of the struggles I overcame with our dances and that I’ve gotten better at memorizing them.

Right now, we’re practicing our old songs and after watching practice videos of us from three years ago, I can’t believe how much I sucked. (everyone laughs) I mean, I still suck now but I feel that I can dance now. (laughs)

\[Minami was part of the group who can’t dance during their training camps, along with Yoppi and Kaya (Okuno Kaya) though according to _Uchiage Gambappe_ Special, she was the first one who got out of that group.\]

**How Do You Imagine Yourself In Three Years?**

Three years… I’d be twenty-five by then. I’ll be the same as always. I’m here because I wanted to be a voice actress and when it comes down to it, I’ve always been a voice actress and that won’t change even three years into the future.

Who knows what the industry will be like three years from now but I’m sure I’ve gotten a deeper understanding of acting by then. Being twenty-five in this industry is quite young. I should say that to myself as well (laughs) but I really think it’s impressive.

So I want to devote myself to acting and I hope that when I’m at that age, I’m more capable of doing more varied and deeper roles.

**5 Months Later…**

**[Looking Back at The Solo Event](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12358425570.html)**

Akita (Kanaashi Nogyo High from Akita Prefecture) reached the grand finals at the Summer Koshien (The High School Baseball Championship), right? It was all over the news. Cameras were taking footage of the front of the station and I got all excited seeing the place where I got off that day, which got me reminiscing about the solo event.

I sang a Namahageez song since the group is based in Akita. I wore the outfit my mom made for my first ever solo event, and I was glad I got to bring a nostalgic vibe like that to the show.

Live house venues are quite small, making it a bit cramped for doing activities as the entire group so I was really happy that I got to be near to them that I could feel their passion in full force, knowing that all of that was for me.

**A New Goal**

I focused on singing for those shows and while it is really enjoyable, there’s still room for improvement, things that I need to do better next time. That goes for every show and my goal is that every time I improve or achieve something on my own, I want to contribute what I learned into helping the girls or anyone else in any way I can.

I know there’s still a lot we have to do, both with the tour and everything else.

**Reactions After The Disband Announcement**

Part of me expected this to happen eventually and while I haven’t fully come to terms with it yet, I remember how shocked people were by the news, including our fans and even people who aren’t fans but at least knew about us. That month, everywhere I went, I’d hear people talk about it and I realized that so many people actually cared about us.

I was so restless that day and a bit scared, wondering how people would take it. But every time we check in and feel sympathetic and sorry for the many people who were upset by it, all we would hear from them were kind words, asking us to never apologize. Hearing all that really raised our spirits and motivated us to work harder than ever before so we could answer that support in the short time we have left.

**Current Thoughts**

I think some things may have changed since then. The first part of our tour just wrapped up and I can’t help thinking that it might be the last time our audience gets to hear us sing those songs. So I’ve started feeling that everything we do might just be the last time we get to do it.

**Personality**

I’m quite the narcissist. I’m open to talk about anything, really, except probably where I live. But I’m not like that all the time, of course.

**Personality (Specifically The Type That Bottles Up Stress)**

I tend to bottle up a lot of self-hatred. It doesn’t happen often but whenever I hope that things will work themselves out and it doesn’t, I would fall into a spiral of regret, thinking that I should have done more, and such, and before I know it, that frustration would quickly well up inside me. As you would expect, it doesn’t end well and I tend to take it out on people.

I’m also not good at expressing my opinions to people so I usually blame myself if I can’t find the right words and avoid the situation entirely. But that also means I let those feelings build up inside which eventually leads me to avoid having to address it properly and letting that person know without having to blow up on them. I guess you could say I’m like that because I hate doing things in half-measures.

**Do You Have A Rival?**

Essentially, I see everyone as my rival. Not just the girls, but also my manager, for example, who is really good at getting her ideas across. Just watching her inspires me to be like that as well.

When I call someone my rival, I don’t just think of competing with them. I also begin to gain a deep understanding of their strengths, which motivates me to do better.

**The Importance Of “Appreciation”**

I believe what’s important is… Love……... I’m just waiting for the echo, by the way. (everyone laughs)

I don’t know about the capital-L word “Love” itself but love or rather, that feeling of appreciation is something irreplaceable and can motivate anyone through anything. A lot of people made that trip to Aomori. It was rough but they came anyway despite it and that really meant a lot to me.

Whenever I lose confidence in myself, I read letters that encourage me to do my best because they like my voice. To be honest, it actually works. (laughs) That’s why I hold that word in high regard.

**Preparing For The Solo Event**

I won’t blame anyone if this new song doesn’t resonate with them, but if I try my best to dig deep within myself and convey the meaning of the lyrics until it comes across to them, then it’s more than enough for me.

But first and foremost, I have to enjoy it too. I shouldn’t worry about making mistakes because I know everything’s going to be fine since everyone is there with me.

**What Is _Wake Up, Girls!_** **To You?**

(Agonizes over what to say) All right, here goes. It might sound obvious and repetitive but for me, _Wake Up, Girls!_ is “Home”, a place to return to.

I imagine everyone must have said the same thing because whatever we do, it all comes back to the fact that we’re WUG. That WUG is where I, Aoyama Yoshino, a voice actress affiliated with 81 Produce, started from. That each and every one of these opportunities wouldn’t have happened if WUG never formed. I’m sure everyone feels the same way too.

We’ve gotten as close as we have because we’re family. Because we wanted to understand each other. Because we’ve gone through moments of conflict, loneliness, and neglect.

It’s home that I want to cherish. But that being said, I want to feel that way, knowing that I also need to learn how to live without taking anything for granted, just like when I left for Tokyo.

**A Recent Funny Anecdote**

I remembered this just now. So we have a LINE group just for the seven of us and we usually post group photos there in occasions where we get together for lessons. And in one of them, Atsugi Nanami (Acchan) from _Run Girls, Run!_ was with us.

So when that photo was posted, I asked if it’s Acchan. Someone said yes and I commented on how cute she is. But then Nanami… Not Acchan Nanami, our Nanami (Yamashita Nanami), replied with a “Thank you” sticker (laughs) then immediately followed up with a “Wrong!” sticker. (laughs)

As LINE stickers go, it wasn’t unlikely that it may have been sent by mistake, like to a different group or something. So I checked again, thinking that it was directed at me, then I just died laughing. It was so hilarious. It got completely mixed up. I replied afterward, telling her she’s cute as well. (laughs)

**Initially Misunderstood**

At first, my family didn’t understand me. I wanted to be a voice actress, so when I was in my first year of middle school, I decided to try out for an audition. They were holding one in Fukuoka at the time, but going there meant taking the bullet train. I was a twelve-year-old middle schooler who had no experience doing that whatsoever so I had no choice but to tell my mom.

But when I approached my family about it… They just laughed. They were saying things like how great it is to be young and ambitious, and that I should probably give up on my dream because I’ll never be good at it, all with smiles on their faces. They completely understand me now but back then, it frustrated me.

**What Got Them To Understand \[Cuts in from the previous line\]**

It was through things familiar to them, like TV programs or anime where they get to hear my voice, that I got them to take me seriously. I guess it started from there. I never really asked them to understand me. Honestly, I wanted to force myself through to them and see me eye-to-eye.  

**5 Months Later…**

[**Looking Back At The Solo Event**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12358646378.html)

It all came down to whether or not anyone could even get there. Tohoku was hit by a pretty intense snowstorm that day, which made the roads unusable and delayed the overnight buses. That got me worried that maybe no one might even show up once I started hearing that people might not be able to come anymore. Then suddenly, the airport started sending out provisionary buses and everything worked out thanks to that.  

So all in all, what should have been a regular event turned into quite an ordeal. They had to go through so much just to get there so I knew I should respond to that and make it up for them, which hyped me up even more.

**Regarding the Disband Announcement**

When the moment came, that’s the first time it truly sunk in that we’re all going our separate ways come March. It’s like that feeling you get before you graduate from high school. I hated it, so I made it my goal to make as many memories as possible since that would be the best way to approach it.

Everyone felt the same, especially the girls and the staff who have been with us all this time and have gotten closer to. We thought that if we spend our moments that way, we’ll create memories that hopefully will last forever.

**The Day Of The Announcement**

I felt restless since I already knew how it was going to be presented and when it was going to be announced. Then it all became real once the announcement came and all kinds of useless thoughts swirled in my head, one after another.

But what surprised me the most were the unbelievable amount of messages coming from colleagues and friends, as well as long-time fans who were putting their feelings into words as best they can. It was my day off so I spent it reading each and every message, almost as if it’s my own way of getting through the pain.

**Post-Announcement Morale**

Things between us definitely changed a bit since then because we talk every day as if it’s going to be our last. Lately, though, we’ve settled back into our usual groove which consists of me making jokes that never gets a laugh, everyone getting competitive at card games and having fun playing werewolf \[A social-deduction game similar to Mafia\]. So that light-hearted atmosphere hasn’t changed at all.

**Message To Fans**

I’ll stay optimistic as I always have and smile because I don’t want people to feel sad. Otherwise, everyone will stop smiling eventually and everyone will truly be sad.

I understand it’s hard to accept because I know all too well how sad and painful it is. But at the very least, I want to accept all those feelings and smile in spite of it all. That hopefully by the end of it, once we cross that finish line, everyone will be smiling.

**Inspiration To Audition For _Wake Up, Girls!_**

I realized that I haven’t decided on what to do with my life when I got the questionnaire where you had to write down your plans after graduating high school. I started wondering what kind of life I wanted and I remembered that I had a childhood dream of becoming an idol.

I love singing, so much that I used to spend so much time at our patio when I was 3 or 4 years old singing made-up songs. (laughs) Since I made them myself, I would keep going for ten minutes or more. (laughs) Imagine just singing a ten-minute chorus. (laughs) It was crazy and we had some of them recorded on video as a reminder of who I was back then.

So when it came time to write my plans for the future, I thought I might as well give that dream a shot and try out since I would be going to college anyway. So I told my mom and she looked for one right away and found the WUG audition.

We were cutting it close to the application deadline so we rushed to a photo studio in the middle of the night to have my photo taken for the application letter that we mailed as soon as we could. I never expected to pass but I figured it would make for a good experience.

**Unaware That It’s A Voice Acting Audition**

I initially thought it was for a singing audition because of the name \[_2nd Anisong Vocal Audition -- Wake Up, Girls!_\] but I was wrong. In the application packet, we only needed to include a CD recording of me singing so I went into the initial screening without any doubts because I thought I only had to sing.

But when I advanced to the second screening and was handed a script, that’s when I realized it. I mean, I can be that scatterbrained, so when it hit me, I just thought, “Oh, this is actually a voice acting audition.” (laughs)

It was still quite rough around the edges at the time but my voice carried me through… probably. (laughs) I had no idea that my voice was peculiar. It never crossed my mind since my mom is also that way and I hadn’t listened to a recording of my voice so I never knew for myself. Boys always teased me about it but I just brushed them off and carried on as usual. (laughs) I only really became conscious of it once I entered this industry.

\[Kaya also made the same mistake, thinking that it was for strictly anisong because she literally stopped reading past “Anisong Vocal Audition” because it was too long.\]

**Fortune Telling Anecdote**

I asked a fortune teller about my future career and she told me I’ll have a long career as a long distance runner. (laughs) She said that I won’t be an ace, but more like those people under their shadow who take in other roles or tackle long stretches in a marathon. Honestly, I still have no idea what that means. (laughs)

That said, after working in this industry for quite a while now, I’ve come to understand that I am better suited for secondary roles with weird and ridiculous personalities instead of main roles.

**Three Things To Do If The World Were To End Tomorrow**

I'd rewatch all the things I’ve worked in. (laughs) That’s one. Then, I’d go and see everyone in my family. I don’t know about the last… enjoy a hot spring with the girls? (laughs) That makes it three.

**What Is _Wake Up, Girls!_** **To You? (asked in the middle of a walk)**

(laughs) Do I have to answer right away? Let me think... Without a doubt, that’s where everything started. That’s where my career began. It’s my debut work. I started to sing and act because of WUG. So what can it be other than my starting point?

Even when I’m in the middle of doing other projects… I feel right at home once I come back to WUG. It’s a place dear to me. I’m sure it will always have a place in my heart and will always be in my thoughts as I continue on in this career.

**5 Months Later…**

[**Looking Back At The Solo Event**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12360859069.html)

It was hard picking souvenirs. I eventually decided to get everyone hand warmers with handwritten personal messages and it took quite a while to write them, much longer than the amount of time we have for rehearsals. (laughs) So that experience stuck with me since it was something that I worked on with my own hands.

**After the Disband Announcement**

I had already braced myself for it since our debut and that moment was a test of that. It was like the start of a new beginning where we suddenly have to hit the ground running, and it became more important to cherish each and every opportunity we get with our fans.

Personally, I’m spending that time putting in more effort so I can shine brighter in my other projects. There’s a limit on the time we have left as WUG so I want to see the girls smile. We’ve been seeing each other once or twice a week but I can see how that won’t be the case anymore once we disband, so I want to make lots of memories with them while we still have it.

**Future Goals**

I want to continue my solo career as a voice actress so think it’s time for me to dig deep into myself and figure things out. I always dreamed to be in lots of children’s anime, and I hope to become someone who can bring those characters to life for them even if they have no knowledge about voice actors.

While I want to develop my reputation as “Yamashita Nanami” but I also want to be a voice actress who can make children’s dreams come true through my characters. That’s what I’m aiming for right now, one step at a time.

**Message To Fans**

I wrote “again and again” on my outfit sash for our anniversary live back in April. It felt like a turning point in my life as if I’m standing on a crossroads. I know it’s a choice that I’ll have to make multiple times but I’m sure that every time, I’ll always choose the path that will get me to see everyone again, so I could make happy memories with them again, so I could spend time together with them again.

That’s what “again and again” is trying to say.

# Okuno Kaya

![](/images/vlcsnap-2019-06-13-21h27m15s372.png)

**Inspiration To Become A Voice Actress**

I was in high school when voice actors started gaining attention in the mainstream that you would see magazines being published about them. It got me thinking that they’re capable of doing a variety of things. They do voices and photoshoots, which seemed fun. They also sing and dance. They can do practically everything and as someone who was getting interested in anime at the time, I was enamored by them.

\[Kaya had mentioned that she practiced doing voices by watching anime and imitating all the voices in it and that she would do it in secret in her room because her family never knew about her dream to become a voice actress until she suddenly opened up about it as she was about to graduate from high school.  
  
She even recalled one instance of practicing after mistakenly assuming that no one was home until her mother noticed the sounds and called for her. She panicked and stayed silent, acting as if nothing happened.\]

**Passing The Audition**

It had been a month since the final audition when I received a call asking me to come over to their office. They told me it was for the final screening, specifically an interview and they wanted me to bring my parents along and see everyone, including the staff. So I said I would go then my mom and I went to Tokyo.

I had assumed a lot of people were called in and even worried about the questions they might ask me. But when I came in, all they said was, “As you may have guessed, you passed.”

The thought never even crossed my mind (laughs) so I was completely surprised.

**Current Activities**

I want to focus on being an anime voice actress but right now I still want to improve myself and my polish my skills in WUG.

While I enjoy doing live shows, I also love interacting directly with fans, such as in release events for books and anime CDs where I would hand out limited release items to them and directly hear from them their opinions like how they find my character cute or how much they enjoyed an event I was in. I really enjoy having those opportunities with them.

**Sentiments Toward Tohoku**

The plan for this year’s solo event tour was to hold parts of it in Aomori, Akita, and Yamagata. Those are places that we haven’t done any events in and probably would never go to, both for us and our fans, if weren’t for this. That’s why it made me very happy since it made for a perfect opportunity for them to finally experience the local delicacies of the area. As someone from Tohoku, it goes without saying that I have a deep appreciation for it and nothing would make me happier if people feel the same way.

I know people go there because Sendai is where _Wake Up, Girls!_ is set but I do hope that aside from our events, including this solo event tour, that lots of people will keep coming to Tohoku.

**Future Goals**

Most of the roles I’ve done up to now had different voices because I want to be able to do all sorts of them.

I find that every new role is a chance to try something new so that little by little, I get to expand the types of voices I can do, not just in their manner of speaking, but also in the mood they’re trying to evoke. And in doing so, I also hope to express the many sides I have within me.

**5 Months Later…**

[**Looking Back At The Solo Event**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12362965018.html)

Both shows ended up being quite intense that it’s still clear in my memory. I remember the audience going crazy calling my name after they ended. It was so intense that I couldn’t stop myself and even thought of showing myself to them but the staff practically begged me through the earpiece not to come out no matter what. (laughs) So I didn’t and cheered them on instead. Regardless though, it was fun.

**The Day Of The Disband Announcement**

That morning was unbearably quiet. It was the day after the Rakuten Golden Eagles Collaboration Event in Sendai and I was alone at the hotel, having miso soup as breakfast and feeling anxious the entire time because I knew that today was the day. The soup really kept my spirits up. (laughs)

**After The Announcement**

I was worried if things from here on out will be okay since many of our fans were definitely saddened by the news. But it was exactly because of it that I need to treasure each and every moment we have with everyone, and I tried my best to approach the word “disband” in a positive light instead.

There are still moments that I have to tell myself to keep my head up but right now, want to focus on being optimistic and practical as I look forward to things that I wish to do in the future.

**What Comes Next**

Various aspects of _Wake Up, Girls!_ won’t be going away so I believe there are still things that I hope I can still contribute to.

**Message To Fans**

I’m truly grateful to our fans, both new and old, for finding us and for supporting us all the way. I’ll make sure to work hard after we disband so we can see each other again in all sorts of events.

# Takagi Miyu

![](/images/Miyu_Takagi.png)

**Enjoying Alcohol**

I love eating delicious food so I always end up craving for something to drink.

Whenever I go to places such as Sendai, I usually buy pickled seafood from souvenir shops because they’re perfect with alcoholic beverages and it’s a kind of luxury that I’ve recently just gotten into. My dad actually loves alcohol as well and today he actually bought some salmon, pickled cod, and dried stingray fillet for the both of us, since we enjoy the same things. (laughs)

I don’t uncontrollably crave for it but I do enjoy drinking by myself while playing a game or watching TV.

**Motivation To Audition**

I was in my third year of middle school when I entered the First Anisong Vocal Audition, the one before WUG, which was for i☆Ris. My friends, who I hang out and sing karaoke with, suggested that I try out because my voice was cute. It really was something that trivial that spurred me to do it.

It was my first ever audition and I got as far as the final screening where I saw Serizawa Yu and Kubota Miyu, who eventually became members of i☆Ris. I could already feel that they had that special something and I just had to accept that I won’t stand a chance against them. So for the Second Anisong Vocal Audition, I told myself that this will be the one for sure.

\[The way she described the first audition was that she got overwhelmed by the level of dedication everyone had and got discouraged once she realized that she didn’t want it as much as everyone else did. After that, she took that lesson to heart and dedicated herself to doing better for the next one, going as far as joining the track and field club to become physically fit (She also did it to ease out of her developing gaming obsession at the time that became one of the reasons for her to quit ballet and gain weight) and studying what exactly she was getting into.\]

**Solo Event Concept**

My solo event was held in Sendai Macana, which I believe was the largest venue of the tour. I wanted to create a vibe that matches my character, Okamoto Miyu, but I also made sure to include certain songs that I knew my fans would enjoy as they have year after year, while taking this opportunity to exhibit my interests.

Since I’ll be performing in her hometown, I thought it would be great if I portrayed as Okamoto Miyu for the first half of the show, both as a way to mix things up and as thanks for always being my constant companion.

**Gratitude Toward Fans Who Have Gone To The Solo Events**

I don’t get many opportunities to express my hobbies, so it makes me really happy when I see them eagerly anticipate and enjoy my attempts at doing them. You might say it’s because I love trying new things and challenging myself but it is very encouraging when I see that from them.

I’m grateful because I’m afraid of stagnating and I worry if my fans would enjoy seeing me do this or that. So I do these solo events while hoping that if they see me happy and having fun, they would feel the same way. Because as long as someone out there is impressed that I’m capable of doing these things, it motivates me and makes it all worth it.

\[Miyu always showcased a particular skill at every solo event, namely guitar, drums and DJing.  DJing in particular was a thing she thought of doing for the 2018 solo event that eventually turned into one of her main talents.\]

**5 Months Later…**

[**Looking Back At The Solo Event**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12363209637.html)

I thought of the concept “Maid in Sendai” since it was going to be held in Okamoto Miyu’s hometown of Sendai, not to mention in MACANA live house, so it felt very poetic.

I was very glad that I got to do it there because it was a heartwarming experience to perform and see all the bright and earnest smiles from everyone.

**Recent Thoughts**

Up until the actual announcement, I was so worried about how it would affect our relationship with our fans. While there were people saddened by it, I was glad that a lot of people also took kindly to it and expressed that they’ll keep supporting us even in our future endeavors. So we’ll carry that unending support and we’ll do our very best to answer it.

**The Day Of The Announcement**

I could hardly keep myself together that day. I kept an eye on places like twitter, anxious about how everyone would take to the news. I saw how upset our fans were and I just wanted to go out there and hear from them directly as soon as we could since it was a complicated situation where people were concerned if this is really it or if there’s something more after this.

Still, disbanding the unit was something that we decided on as well so instead of seeing it as a sad turn of events, we hoped that people would see it in a positive way.

**Sentiments Toward The Members**

We started together and been together all this time as we faced one thing after another. I know it’s something I’ve taken for granted given that we see each other more often than not so I just want to say again how grateful I am to have met such wonderful people.

**Message To Fans**

I know there’s a lot to process regarding the fact that we’re disbanding but I would appreciate it if you’re there to support each of us as we take our next step. There’s still time for us to do what we can as WUG so I encourage you all to come and see us at the tour and our other events so I can meet you all and express my gratitude directly.
