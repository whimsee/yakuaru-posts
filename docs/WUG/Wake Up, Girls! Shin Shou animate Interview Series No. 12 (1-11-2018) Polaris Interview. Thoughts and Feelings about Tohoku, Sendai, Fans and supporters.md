**\-- With the anime** **_Wake Up, Girls! New Chapter_** **(****_Shin Shou_****) ending soon, candidly speaking, I would like to hear your thoughts about it.**  

Yoshioka Mayu (Mayu): I heard discussions about a new season right around when we recorded 7 Senses and that was so long ago. I think it’s been a year since then and I'm proud that we spent that time promoting _Shin Shou_.  

Tanaka Minami (Minami): 2017 went by fast. It’s hard to imagine how quickly time passed between the stage play \[Aoba no Kiroku\] in January until Shin Shou started airing. I remember recording lines for it right in the middle of our live tour, but it all feels like everything went like, “Whoosh!”  (laughs)  

Okuno Kaya (Kaya): I couldn’t wait any longer for it to begin airing but once it did, the fact that it's about to end just snuck up on me. I feel a little sentimental but I know it’s our turn now to carry that momentum and excitement from here on.  

Aoyama Yoshino (Yoshino): As they have mentioned, it was a very busy year for us. The stage play brought us back to the challenges and hardships we faced during the past 3 years as WUG, we did a tie-up song and, because of Shin Shou, we were invited to Anisama (_Animelo Summer Live 2017 -THE CARD-_).  

The entire year felt like we spent it focusing on _Shin Shou_; even the ideas for our tour had some sort of connection to it. Now that it's about to end though, I’ve been feeling restless like you would feel the day before your birthday when you wonder if there’s anything else you need to do.  

Eino Airi (Airi): The plan for the tour was to make people aware that a new season of the anime is coming. It had been a while since we had one so we thought of ways of showing that side of us once again. It was a long road but I can relax a little now knowing that all of this would not have been possible if it weren’t for everyone supporting us and the series.  

Takagi Miyu (Miyu): We've done a lot of work for _Shin Shou_. We did motion capture during its production and prepared many ideas to promote it up until it started airing. I’ve been wondering what everyone feels about it so I look forward to hearing their thoughts once it is over.  

Yamashita Nanami (Nanami): While I can rest easy now that the anime is ending soon, it feels rewarding to see the girls on screen once again. It’s the product of the work we did as a voice acting unit when nothing new was happening for the anime, so seeing it come to this makes me really happy.  

\[At the time, they referred to 2016 as a tough year. No new anime developments would supposedly mean no new songs, no additional promotion, and no Anisama. Regardless, it was a busy and productive year for them in many ways.  
  
They did more small events, outreach (free shows), and promotions in various places including places outside Tokyo Metro, new songs were made just for the tour (Character song series 2, _Tightrope runaway_, and _Outlander rhapsody_. Also, _Higawari Princess_ for the gimmick though it is also an AEON Collaboration song) and they also did their first anime tie-up for _Scorching Ping Pong Girls_ (_Shakunetsu no Takkyuu Musume_) with _Bokura no Frontier_. This was a turning point as well because, in spite of their concerns at the time if people actually care about them as a unit independent from the anime, this was where they began seeing themselves as an artist group.\]

**7 Girls Sharing a Dream**

* * *

**\-- It sounds like your year was just as busy and hectic as ever. Moving on, can you tell me your favorite scene or episode in _Shin Shou_****?**  

Nanami: My favorite scene is the one where the girls from _Run Girls, Run!_ (RGR) were handing out flyers to promote their event. We’ve done that before and even handed out posters during Comiket. Seeing them going through it reminded me of that experience, and it made me want to root for them.

![](/images/1515390788_1_7_f22b2f2f28849e421d3ac1f7116f1de5.jpg)

Miyu: For me, it’s the scene where the girls finally reunited with Oga Namahageez. They even came in as guests for Miyu-chan's show. It made me really glad because it highlighted the bonds they shared since their first encounter and how they eventually became one of their supporters.  

![](/images/1515390788_1_10_9e5c56adbb6f1909c7163bed553db3f0.jpg)

**\-- I think Miyu-chan became quite an instrumental figure in** **_Shin Shou_** **since she came up with the name** **_Run Girls, Run!_** **and** **_Wake Up, Idols!_**  

Miyu: It surprised me too.  

Mayu: She has a keen sense for those.  

Miyu: She radiated a lot of her positive energy in _Shin Shou_. Even when everyone's down, she's always ready and willing to brighten the mood. That was something I tried my best to project.  

**\-- Thank you. How about you, Eino-san?**  

Airi: It would have to be the dance sequences. I always thought of our link with the girls as one of our strong points. The harder we work, the better it reflects on them. I like that connection and with motion capture, we get to show that off even more than before.

![](/images/1515390788_1_13_7adaf051b83fb8bf21df408e5ca2149f.jpg)

**\-- There's even a scene where Airi-chan was doing her best to improve her dancing. Though I have to say she really stood out on stage thanks to the motion capture.**  

Airi: I imagine fans might have wondered how she'll manage since she wasn't good at dancing but she's the hardest worker of them all. So in the time that passed, she worked hard to improve and everyone got to see the result of that.  

**\-- It’s true that she’s really stepped up and became someone who is there to support everyone. Next, Aoyama-san.**  

Yoshino: Since Miyu already mentioned Oga Namahageez... Oh, right. Unlike before, I like how quickly they always manage to get themselves back on their feet whenever they face problems.  
  
Each of them carries a lot of personal worries and insecurities, but they get to open up whenever they're together. They get to share their burdens with the others and spread the weight among all of them. All the hardships, moments of joy and sadness... they talk it out and find solutions together, which I think is something to admire.  

Kaya: What stuck out to me was a dialogue between Kaya-chan and Yoshino-chan. They were getting busier, which meant they have to spend less time with everyone. While it was good for their solo careers, it also came with its own share of worries. Their talk showed how much Kaya cares for WUG because she knows that getting more solo work is important but she also wants to treat WUG with the same importance.  

![](/images/1515390788_1_16_a47544c7c8bcbbf477c81dea502b4c26.jpg)

**\-- As the leader and sub-leader, both of them really care a lot about their group. But in terms of the actual unit, do you also stick to those roles?**  

Yoshino: All I’ll say is we’re still a work-in-progress. (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

Airi: That's not true at all! (laughs)  

Yoshino: Well, there are moments when Kaya is somewhat dependable!  

Kaya: Only somewhat? (grins broadly)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

Kaya: I guess from time to time whenever we talk about work?  

Yoshino: Yeah… I think so...  

Minami: You're both so lax.  

**\-- (laughs) How about you, Tanaka-san?**  

Minami: I like the scene where Minami-chan and Nanami-chan were practicing how to harmonize with each other. We had our work cut out for us. I remember spending so much time that day getting it right. (laughs) Didn’t we hole up somewhere just to practice?  

Nanami: We did.  

Minami: We were going like, "did we match up?” and “maybe this works…” so you couldn't believe how happy we were when we got the OK. (laughs) We practiced it maybe a hundred times...  

Nanami: Right.  

Minami: Minami-chan and Nanami-chan often get into conflicts but they sync really well once they team up. It makes you want to follow their example and see past each other’s differences to get the job done.  

**\-- That topic came up frequently in other** **_WUG Shin Shou_** **Backstage Interviews. It sounds like you both did really well.**  

Nanami: Actually, we're both pretty bad at harmonizing. (laughs)  

Minami: Even more so in our live performances. Minami-chan gets praise for it but I've never gotten that myself! (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

Nanami: I was nervous since we were doing it in front of the I-1 Club cast. (laughs)  

![](/images/1515390788_1_19_76a9e180ab5bc526b27b8fcda545aeef.jpg)

**\-- That's unexpected to know. How about you, Yoshioka-san?**  

Mayu: It would have to be Shiraki-san. He’s the stoic founder of I-1 Club and there was a scene in particular where he looked human. That was the first time in the series that you see him worried, that he wasn’t perfect, which I found interesting.  

Seeing his I-1 Club, something he devoted all his time to, in a slump must have agonized him and you see him do things like rely on Hayasaka-san for help, or react with contempt to the idea of Virtual Idols. It made me realize how much of himself he poured into his projects and it paints a picture of the idol industry through the hardened eyes of a veteran who sees everyone as his rival.  

![](/images/1515390788_1_22_d56b0a8d73dd6440265ee3a28ada9dc1.jpg)

**\-- Hearing that reminds me of Episode 10 where Mayu-chan broke down in front of everyone.**  

Mayu: I think that's the only time she let herself go.  

**\-- There’s also that time when Airi-chan was thinking of quitting before Mayu-chan and Yoshino-chan tried to stop her. Yoshino-chan was sobbing but Mayu-chan wasn't crying at all.**  

Minami: Yeah. She was smiling, even.  

Mayu: I think the incident in episode 10 is what finally brought her on the same level as the others, instead of someone who always seemed to be a step ahead. Now, in spite of their increasing workload and personal issues, they’re all on the same page, sharing the same feelings.

**The Moment Polaris was Born**

* * *

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di7AeqiRCAU

**\-- Moving on, let's talk about Polaris, particularly the lyrics. I have a few questions I’ve been meaning to ask now that you’re free to talk about it with the media.**  

Mayu: Finally!!  

Miyu: How long ago did we finish it?  

Mayu: I think right before the tour started.  

Nanami: About 6 months ago?  

Mayu: That's right! We were on our way to Los Angeles for Anime Expo 2017's Anisong World Matsuri and we decided the title at the airport.  

Minami: We were waiting there for so long.  

Miyu: It was good for us overall, though.  

Mayu: We woke up early that day to do motion capture before flying to the US. So while we waited, we deliberated on the lyrics. Actually, the moment that decided the title happened just as we got off an escalator.  

**\-- So you decided the title first?**  

Mayu: We already knew how it sounded but it was hard writing lines for it without a theme so we started with the title.  

**\-- How did you arrive on Polaris?**  

Minami: There’s a scene in the anime referencing that where the girls were thinking up lyrics and came across the word "Star". Mayushii and I arrived at the same idea by chance. We thought how nice it would be for a song to revolve around the concept of stars and so it became “Polaris”.  

\[According to the blog, another Polaris interview, and Five Stars (2018/3/28), “Polaris” happened at Haneda airport while they were waiting for their flight to LAX for Anisong World Matsuri. Mayu, Minami, and Yoppi (Yoshino) were bouncing ideas around, and the topic of stars came up. Minami googled the word and came across “Polaris”, which sounded cool to her. At the same time, Mayu arrived at word herself.\]  

Miyu: 7 Stars and it’s a nice callback to _7 Girls War_.  

**\-- Did you know that Polaris is the North Star and located near the Big Dipper, which is a constellation made up of seven stars and matches number of WUG members?**  

Mayu: Actually, if you look at our formation from above, you'll see us forming the big dipper, with the audience representing the North Star. That’s what the last line of the song "_datte kimi mo boku wo terasu Polaris_" means. They are our Polaris as much as we are to them.  

![](/images/1515390788_1_28_c2d1907d6277c098ff1895bb6c98f1d8.jpg)

**Feelings toward Sendai and Tohoku**

* * *

**\-- I got the impression that Polaris is WUG's message to the fans. Like it's thanking them for their continued support over the years. The first verse was especially impactful, particularly Eino-san's part.**  

Airi: The ideas I contributed to the lyrics were about Sendai and Tohoku, and how WUG will never forget about them, no matter what. I wanted that impart those feelings as someone who has experienced the earthquake first-hand.  

\[The line being referenced is “_tanoshii mo ureshii mo nami ga nomikomu no_” which roughly means (including Kaya’s lines in the verse that she’ll refer to later), “The sights, and the fun and happy times we shared submerged into darkness by the waves.”\]  

Mayu: I was able to come up with so many lines thanks to Airi. I think her line wouldn't hold any meaning if she didn't sing it. Because while it is important that the lyrics flow naturally with the music, it's just as important to have its meaning conveyed properly and I really went through her lines together to make sure I wasn't going to offend anyone.  

Yoshino: Mayushii and I deliberated whether to use the concept of "Darkness" or "Waves" as a theme. We eventually decided on "Darkness" since it has a more direct meaning, but I couldn't think of anything else to contribute. I think only Kaya and Airi would be able to understand why WUG came to be so it's only fitting that Aichan sings that line and I'm looking forward to conveying that message to everyone live.

**Dividing the Lyrics**

* * *

**\-- It's interesting how much thought and consideration were poured into these lyrics. Didn’t you also divide the lyrics among the members, Yoshioka-san?**  

Mayu: We had so many talks about that. Our music producer and Tanaka-san (composer) provided us with a guideline but it was up to me to decide how it all comes together. On top of the overall balance, I also took into account which lines I want each member to sing and if the line matches their character. The verse lines start out with heavy themes but it changes to bright and optimistic final lines leading to the chorus, so I thought of giving those to Miyu and Minami.  

\[The verse lines flowed based on pitch. Medium (Yoppi) gradually going lower (Nanami, Kaya, Airi) then rising quickly (Miyu) until it punctuates (Minami, Miyu for 2nd) leading to the chorus.\]  

**\-- So that's why you ended the second verse with Takagi-san.**  

Miyu: I was glad I get to sing the more optimistic lines. Just by looking at the lyrics, it's easy to pick out who gets to sing which and I think our respective lines fit us perfectly.  

![](/images/1515390788_2_4_64088ea84b8d437afcbd2272e49371ae.jpg)

**\-- What about you, Okuno-san? Did anything about the lyrics stand out to you?**  

Kaya: My line in the first verse, “_kimi to mita keshiki sae kuroku nuritsubusaete_” was inspired from Kikuma Kaya's personal experiences since it speaks about what happened to her close friend. I saw right away I would be singing that line and I knew that the best way to express it is through my character's voice, so I really leaned into her persona.  

**\-- So it was like you were singing as both Kikuma Kaya and Okuno Kaya. Moving to the chorus, I noticed there was a difference in the way Tanaka-san and Yamashita-san were harmonizing between both.**  

Minami: I was the harmony and Nanami was the main vocal in the first one, then it was the other way around the next.  

Nanami: It was a reference to the anime where they both tried to harmonize. And to better emphasize it, our voices were louder than usual.  

**\-- Actually, this reminds of a part in** **_Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_** **where you also harmonized. Has there been a similar instance like that in your songs since then?**  

Both Nanami and Minami: Not at all. (laughs)  

Minami: That role goes to Mayushii and Yoppi, so I think having us do it keeps things new.  

**\-- It definitely does. Another thing I find interesting about this song is the number of unconventional ideas it has because I noticed Yoshioka-san didn't have a solo in the regular verses.**  

Mayu: I was originally supposed to be part of both but I requested to be taken out because I wanted the others to sing them. Actually, this was something I insisted all the way until they said yes.  
  
They advised me that, since the song has a lot of short parts, the center not having a solo would be a little strange but I didn't want to back down and tried to convince them until it became what it is now.  

**\-- I see. Did you encounter any difficulties during recording?**  

Yoshino: It was actually surprising how smoothly it came together. I was expecting it to be a struggle but I guess the fact that the lyrics came from ourselves helped a good deal.  

I think of it like how you can get into a song easily if you made it yourself. Polaris represents the four years we've shared since debuting as WUG and it feels like it's congratulating us.  

Minami: Congratulations! (laughs)  

Yoshino: (comical laugh)

![](/images/1515390788_2_7_e2d50602a230c083c67a61b7cd4ef0ae.jpg)

**\-- Well said. It's good to know that the recording went well. Another thing I noticed is that the overall singing style feels different.**  

Nanami: Unlike our other songs, the direction we went with was to sing as if we're reading lines of poetry instead of matching to the rhythm, which changed how we approached it.  

![](/images/1515390788_2_10_5e76ea7dc767be415f74281634a566a2.jpg)

**\-- That’s surprising. What's your highlight of the song?**  

Mayu: That's a tough question...  

Minami: How about the chorus where we go "_kira kira kira kagayaku_"?  

Mayu: Our voices in the chorus were actually divided as well so it's worth a closer listen to figure it out who gets paired. There's also the last part where we go "la la la". We wanted it to be a song that everyone can sing so we decided to use those lines, and I'm looking forward to singing it with everyone in a live show.  

\[According to Mayu, when she wrote Polaris, she imagined them singing it while enveloped in a “sea of stars”. It was a pipe dream that she never imagined would come true until they got to perform and sing it everyone in Animelo Summer Live 2018 and Animax Musix 2018 Yokohama. She wrote that was very grateful to WUG for making it happen.\]

**WUG in 2017. WUG in 2018.**

* * *

**\-- Thank you for sharing the behind-the-scenes details about Polaris's creation. Next, how would you describe 2017 as WUG, the voice acting unit?**  

Yoshino: It was a terrific year filled with event after event, especially with the _Love Tyrant_ (_Renai boukun_) tie-up and our collaboration with May'n. We overcame so many hurdles with her to make _Wake Up, May'n!_ and the _Restaurant to Another World_ (_Isekai Shokudō_) tie-up happen, so I think it's an unbelievably fortunate year for us as well.  

It's thanks to the support of our fans that a lot of our dreams were realized. WUM became a reality because of the overwhelmingly positive reception at AnimeJAM and we want to do all we can to repay what that support. So I'd sum up this year as the one where our dreams came true!  

\[The surprise collaboration in AnimeJAM 2016 happened because May'n watched them perform in Nendroid Live at the start of the year and was taken in by them that she asked their staff if the could somehow work together, and they eventually did when she learned that they will be in AnimeJAM and they performed Tachiagare as (unofficially at the time) WUM.\]  

Airi: We grew a lot as individuals in 2017 and I truly felt what amazing group we are. Each of us has our own unique personalities that get amplified even more when we're together. I want to show more people what we're capable of as we enter our 5th year in 2018. 

**\-- I heard you're even hosting a Tohoku Rakuten Eagles sponsored event in Sendai.**  

Airi: Yes. I'm very grateful for the opportunity. It makes me glad thinking how WUG's name is spreading to even more places.  

**\-- Thank you. How about for Takagi-san and Yamashita-san.**  

Miyu: I experienced a lot of new things since our stage play in January and I'm excited to see what the next year has in store for us and what else we get to do.  

Nanami: Once we learned that a new season was coming out, it became the year where we all put our heads together and thought of ways to promote _Shin Shou_ and I think our bonds deepened as a result of that. So for 2018, I want to reach out even more to those who have supported us and the anime.  

![](/images/1515390788_2_16_5995e03224ec49ad600fa9ea1ea8f5c1.jpg)

**\-- You showed a completely different side of yourself in** **_WUG BAN Shin Shou_****.**  

NanamI: It's a variety show so I really wanted to put myself out there. (laughs) I haven’t opened up like that before and I have Airi to thank for it.  

Airi: No way! It's nothing!  

Nanami: I think it's because of her leading me along that I was able to do that much. (laughs)  

**\-- You even showed off your hopscotch skills. \[Referencing** _**WUG Shin Shou Episode 7 WUG BAN Special**_**\]**  

Nanami: I’m not your average skipper now, you know. \[She did some questionable skipping as well in the original _WUG BAN_\]  

Yoshino: You call that skipping? More like stamping! (laughs)  

Minami: One step, and another, and another!! (laughs)  

Takagi: They were so quick!! (laughs)  

Nanami: I’m just that good...  

Minami: A pioneer in the field of skipping.  

Kaya: (laughs)  

Mayu: I’ll ask you for tips every time I play.  

![](/images/1515390788_2_19_026489a06d77bcc6f92ef63e2e5d3ea0.jpg)

**\-- (laughs). Please tell me all about it next time. Now, for Yoshioka-san.**  

Mayu: With our tie-ups, the stage play and _Shin Shou_, I genuinely felt the support our fans showed us in 2017. I think those events really highlighted the scope of our capabilities as a voice acting unit so I'm very grateful for our fans who came to support us.  

**\-- If you could put a temperature to it, how would you rate 2017?**  

Mayu: Temperature?! I won't be able to explain why but I'd say 65 degrees \[Celcius\]!  

![](/images/1515390788_2_22_7cc80fdeab3c476ff3c914392169f7fd.jpg)

**\-- 65?! That's setting a high bar for 2018. How about for Tanaka-san.**  

Minami: This year got me thinking a lot WUG, both in terms of the unit and the projects that we're attached to. Back when we started, we were more reckless with how we approached things. But I think we should carefully consider our actions from here on.  
  
We have to consider if what we're doing makes our fans happy, or promotes us in a positive way, that kind of stuff. That's what I’ve been thinking throughout the whole year and it really made me feel how important WUG is for me.  

**\-- I heard you were selected as one of the best newcomers during the** **_11th Seiyuu Awards_** **last March.**  

Minami: With all that's happened this year, the stage play, the trip to Los Angeles and such, I honestly thought that happened ages ago. It was a very hectic year.  

![](/images/1515390788_2_25_291399d594436a6827f35171bf4d6fab.jpg)

**\-- Time really does come and go in a flash once it gets busy. How about you, Okuno-san?**  

Kaya: In Anime Jam, the staff told us that there were so many people who were impressed when they watched us during rehearsals. Like Minami said, we used to be headstrong and reckless but I also feel it's time we think and consider our actions carefully as we go forward.  

We will be singing the ending theme for _Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody_ (_Desu Māchi Kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyōsōkyoku_), which will air in January. I want our momentum from _Shin Shou_ to carry us over to this new project so that more people will know to know about us and the anime.  

**\-- Since it sounds the year of changes for everyone, how did you challenge yourself in 2017?**  

Kaya: I decided to change how I present myself during the tour. Instead of acting as my character, Kikuma Kaya, I wanted to project myself as who I am.  
  
Playing as her in the stage play made me realize how completely different we are, so I wanted to try a big change in myself and stand on stage as myself.  

\[She also wrote that her experience during the stage play being Kikuma Kaya again made her understand her more and what she was going through and it was the first time she actually sincerely cried for one of her characters.  
  
Personal recommendation: Watch 4th live tour and it's a very different Kaya from before and that carried over to events in 2018.\]

**_As long as everyone is happy, I'm happy._**

* * *

**\-- Finally, do you have anything to say to all your fans and supporters who have watched the anime, had come to see you in your events and live shows and were with you every step of the way?**  

Kaya: Thank you for watching _Shin Shou_ all the way through. It makes me really glad and I hope you keep supporting us from here on.  

Minami: We're coming into our 5th year as a group and I'm very grateful for everyone who had gone to our various events, shows, and meet-and-greets. Thank you so much. It's because of your support that we are able to do this much.  
  
Lately, we even get recognized as WUG members in our solo activities, so we'll work hard to get our names out there to more people. Look forward to seeing more of us in the future!  

Mayu: I can never be grateful enough for the amount of support you've given us. Thank you so much. I always wonder if what we're doing is the best way to repay that support. I want to be proud and say that we do. Because if our fans are happy, even a little, then I'm happy.  

**\-- That reminds me of what Shimada Mayu said in the anime about the three ways of achieving happiness, especially how one can achieve it as long as someone out there is happy. So I want to ask if you're happy right now?**  

Mayu: Of course. As long as everyone is happy, I'm as well.  

Minami: How profound!  

![](/images/1515390788_3_1_6f7f42bdfc0ffadf8a207c03b4e5214c.jpg)

**\-- Thank you. How about for Yamashita-san.**  

Nanami: I want to thank everyone who has watched over the girls throughout the entire series as they grow through all the hardships they faced and learn from their personal discoveries. I'm very proud of what they've accomplished and I hope others feel the same.  

Miyu: _Shin Shou_ came to be thanks to the support of our fans and more people got to know about WUG through it. From here on, we will do our best to keep that going. We’ll impress everyone and make them proud for supporting us.  

Airi: Everyone, did you enjoy the final episode? We're all very grateful to you for making Shin Shou a reality. While the anime just ended, the girls, as they have always been, will continue to be a part of us as we move forward with our activities. I hope you come along with us together as we welcome 2018.

**\-- And finally Aoyama-san, leader, would you do the honors.**  

Yoshino: It's been almost 4 years since we made our official debut as voice actresses on January 10, 2014. This might sound a bit unexpected coming from me but I've come to realize many things since then, and what I like most about anime is that it's something you can casually tune in and watch as it comes on TV.  
  
I hope _Shin Shou_ is that show for you. It's easy to watch and, as I've mentioned before, the characters resolve their issues and get themselves back on their feet pretty quickly so every episode is worth watching, no matter which one you happen upon.  
  
As for us as the voice acting unit,  I firmly believe that there is so much more in store for us, that we're about to go tread on uncharted ground. There will be moments where we hesitate and wonder if we are capable of doing it but I believe that we will overcome them together with our fans.  

WUG is a story about all of us, the staff, and every single one of our fans. We're all in this together.  

Thank you so much for making 2017 a wonderful year. We'll all do our best to shine ever brighter like a radiant Polaris in 2018. 

Everyone: This has been Wake Up, Girls! Bye bye!
