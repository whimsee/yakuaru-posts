**\-- This year’s Anisama would be the last for some of the voice acting units performing in it, namely Wake Up, Girls!, Milky Holmes, and DearDream. It's especially emotional for WUG, since they’ve been given such a big stage for a unit that just started, and it seems you had an involvement in it.**

**Saito P:** I considered giving them a shot after watching the anime (Wake Up, Girls!) and reading the script written by Machida Touko. The I-1 Arena, which was supposed to be called I-1 Hall in the initial draft, was where the Idol Festival was held and I figured that the Saitama Super Arena (SSA) in Stadium Mode would make for a good link to the climax of the anime series. In that particular scene, you see the girls, in the middle of hostile territory full of red lights, turn those colors to green, their unit color, and I proposed to make that a reality in Anisama. So if you take a closer look at the logo for Anisama 2014 -ONENESS-, you can see some resemblance to the Idol festival featured in the anime combined with aspects of the stage design of Anisama 2013 -FLAG NINE-.

**\-- It was interesting that the anime featured identical locations of the SSA, down to the details of the backstage.**

**Saito P:** They were given permission to take pictures of the venue and the interior, even the CG data for the stage setup.

**\-- So that’s why it had your name and SSA mentioned in the credits, and why there’s a poster of WUG Shin Shou of the girls standing on center stage in Saitama-Shintoushin Station during this year’s Anisama.**

**Saito P:** I think people know about SSA being a special place for the girls. In last year’s Anisama 2017 - THE CARD-, Tanaka-san shouted “WUG saikou~!!” as they ran to the center stage and we positioned the camera angles to match the scene in _Beyond the Bottom_. For this year, we thought of replicating a development in the last episode of _Shin Shou_ where videos of other idol groups were being streamed to the overhead screen. We wanted “Idol groups” to give WUG an “OK!” message of support in the same vein.

**\-- I want to ask about their appearance for this year’s Anisama. I imagine it happened thanks to the cooperation of multiple sides since it was unexpected that it would be their last.**

**Saito P:** The truth of the matter was that it will be their last. They were added in as the last entry and we didn’t have a lot of time to decide on the setlist. Our drummer, Masshoi, and keyboardist, Jun Imai, played for them before \[Both played for some of their songs and were also part of the live band for the anniversary concert to be released in the 2018 Solo Event URA\], but I felt bad for the other band members for requesting them to do one more song, since I wanted Polaris to be played by them live. We discussed with their label that this year would be a send-off for them. As a producer, including them just because I support them as someone who had worked with them, and it being their last, would not make for a good reason. I made that decision after considering many other factors. I saw the reactions from the fans following the announcement of their disbandment and thought how Anisama was a place where WUGners and fans of Anisama encouraged them and helped them grow. As such, I didn’t want them to feel abandoned and I proposed it as a gesture of utmost support, which lead to the surprise announcement during the opening show of their final tour.

**\[Skipped a few questions\] -- The memorial video showing their performances over the years really seemed to resonate with the girls.**

**Saito P:** That and the send-off video featuring the other units was a surprise. We actually prepared two sets of videos--one for rehearsals, the other for the show itself. I was pretty nervous, actually, because we hadn’t prepared anything in case something goes wrong. (laughs) So I was glad to see their reactions when we pulled it off. Of course, I also had confidence that Mayushii would still be able to sing her long solo part afterward, even if she’s in tears.
