**\-- This doesn't happen often, doesn't it? Both of you often get paired for event appearances but not for interviews.**  

Eino Airi (EA): This is definitely something new. Normally, it's 3 of us or the whole group appearing for interviews like these.  

**\-- Now that I think about it, the first time I knew of you was from way back in a Niconico stream when the anime and the unit were just being introduced.**  

Okuno Kaya (OK): It has been so long. Back then we were still wearing uniforms as outfits…  

EA: And the staff were still using feature phones. I remember watching the whole thing with everyone through 1SEG \[Broadcasting service for mobile phones\] and getting excited whenever we see our names show up... The past 4 years just flew by, hasn't it?

**\-- It has. Now, since we're here to talk about _Suki no Skill_, Wake Up, Girls!'s tie-up song for the anime _Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody_** _**(Desu Māchi Kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyōsōkyoku)**_**... I’ve been meaning to ask, as the title of the song suggests, what are your favorite points about each other, the anime, and WUG in general.**

EA: Oh no! This is going to get a little embarrassing, isn't it? (laughs)  

OK: Yeah. (laughs)  

**\-- I'm dying to know. (laughs) So let's start with the song. I think it shows a quite different side of WUG. What were your first impressions?**  

OK: I feel like it's the perfect ending theme for the anime so I'm glad we get to do it. If I recall correctly, didn't we saw rough sketches of our outfits beforehand...?  

EA: We did.  

OK: They’re so cute and it got me excited what kind of song it'll be. I immediately liked it when I heard it. It gives off Celtic-y vibes...? It's not something I'm actually very familiar with. (laughs) It has a captivating and quaint folk song feel to it like people from a small village played it.  

EA: I always get hyped when I hear our songs for the first time. I can't help but think, "They've done it again!" (laughs)  
  
It was a little different for this one, though. It has a way of drawing you into itself like it's something that came from the other world in the anime. It uses instruments that you don't usually hear so I think it's pretty unconventional.  

**\-- Both of you also get to be the main vocals for this song, which leaves quite a different impression. How did the recording go?**  

EA: I don’t think we did anything out of the ordinary, but we were told to sing in a soft, cute voice all throughout. That said, I wasn’t really conscious of it. I just went with the flow of the song and sang according to my own interpretation.  
  
We did run across a few issues along the way but it went smoothly, all things considered. I was able to impart the feelings of my character, Mia, and the other girls into the song.  

OK: My direction was to bring out my inner gentle side but, like Airi, I sang with my character, Tama’s feelings in mind instead. I imagined her singing while thinking about the protagonist, Satou, who she adores. Sadly, Satou is not interested in her in the same way since he only sees her as a little girl. (laughs) But she wants to watch over and protect him anyway instead of just being protected. So I connected with her feelings in that manner.

![](/images/1519867768811.jpg)

**\-- I usually hear you sing with a low voice so perhaps being more in tune with Tama opens up new approaches to your singing. What was your impression of the final version?**  

OK: We got to utilize our individual vocal styles in different ways, so I’d like everyone to hear out how it came together.  

**\-- Thank you. Next, I would like to know your favorite parts in the song?**  

EA: Let's see... there's so much that I can't choose. (laughs) What sticks out to me though is the beginning where Kaya and I do our solos then it goes "_odorou, sa odorou, migi he rondo_". We don't usually get paired to sing lines together in other WUG songs so it surprised me how well we harmonized. It sounds kind of relaxing and pleasing to the ear.  
  
It felt like we discovered another kind of harmony, even though all seven of us always sing together. It made me realize that there's so much more to discover and I imagine that it'll be the same for our fans as well.  

OK: I have two. First is the Airi's final line, "_Ishoniitai, ayashiteitai, chikaraninaritai_". That's my favorite!  

EA: Thanks ♪  

OK: The next one is the part at the end where we all sing, "_Suki no sukiru. Suki ga sugiru. Suki ni saseru. Suki ga saseru._" I love it because it has a different yet bewitching mood to it. I practiced that part a lot. (laughs)  
  
Oh, yeah! Also, I want everyone to pay attention to the lyrics. "_Suki ga sugiru_" and "_Suki ga saseru_" aren't your usual phrases (laughs) but I want everyone to keep that in mind it when they sing it.  

EA: They sound so nice that it sticks with you. (laughs)  

**\-- It does feel like the song has a lot going with it. Let's move on to the music video. I just watched it and I think it’s pretty cute. Do you have any stories to share during the shoot?**  

EA: The weather was perfect that day and everything was so dazzling under the sunlight that I could barely keep my eyes open when we were recording the dance. (laughs) Fortunately, we all looked okay in the final cut.  

But I do think Kaya looked so radiant at the opening shot thanks to it.  

OK: Hehehe...  

EA: That's my favorite scene. She looks so perfect and ephemeral under that light and she's the only one who can pull that off that it's almost unfair! I love her so much!

**\-- That scene really left a strong opening image. Was that lengthy kind of shot new for you?**

OK: Yes. The premise was that the master of the house would see me returning as I carry a basket full of vegetables. I was surprised that it was such a long cut.  

**\-- The expression you made there was quintessential Kaya. Your smile really left a mark.**  

EA: Right?! It's way too cute!!  

OK: Hehe... I think it's because I've been projecting my persona as Kikuma Kaya in our MVs until now. For this one, I tried to imagine myself as someone who sincerely enjoys serving her master.  

**\-- I see. So that mindset brought up that kind of expression, then. Now, (to Airi) your scene involving the letter was lengthy as well...**  

EA: That's the scene where I accepted a letter from the Master. The idea was that the Master forgot to hand a letter off to me, which left me looking confused as I accepted it.  

**\-- Your face looked like that letter came from someone you like.**  

EA: Yeah. That’s because we all love the Master. We wanted our expressions to convey that feeling.  

**\-- Thank you for your insights. Can you tell me about what went on behind the scenes?**  

OK: When we were filming the scene of us snacking on cookies and macarons, Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) got so into the cookies that she ate so many of them backstage. (laughs) She even got us joining her.  

EA: She even made sure and checked if it was okay to take that many... (laughs)

![](/images/1519825390_1_4_be041783c5aa3ac85aceb2449503d560.jpg)

**\-- That's all for _Suki no Skill_****. Thank you. Now, as I've mentioned at the beginning, let's talk about each other’s favorite points. Let's start with Eino-san.**  

OK: I already feel embarrassed....  

EA: Why? (laughs) Alright. What I like about Kaya is that she's the type that you’ll grow to like more as you get to know her. Because she seems like the quiet type on the surface, right?  
  
But I know that, out of all of us in the group, she's the one who understands herself the most. She strong-willed and commits to her decisions. That's why she's the most reliable out of all of us when we’re down.  

**\-- Ah...**  

EA: She's a very intriguing person. She has so many hidden sides to her that the word “interesting” doesn’t even cut it. I mean, I'm sure our fans already know about this but did you know that she loves walls?  

OK: (laughs)  

EA: It threw me in a loop when I first heard it. (laughs) But that quirky side of her is what makes her who she is.  
  
She watches out for us and she has so many interesting ideas and opinions. She gets more charming the more you get to know her. That's why I adore her.  

OK: It’s so embarrassing. Hehe. But I'm so happy to hear that!  

EA: I'm feeling pretty embarrassed too, you know! Hehe.  

\[Aside from walls, Kaya also wrote how she would like to be reborn as a plankton so she could swim with whales, an animal that she loves and reveres, or… get eaten by them instead which would also mean getting to swim with them.\]  

**\-- I guess you could say that Okuno-san is a deeply profound person. Can you tell me a memorable experience with her?**  

EA: I have a lot but I'll go with this. At first, I honestly thought I wouldn't get along with Kaya because we never really talked that much back then. I mean, since we're both from Tohoku we get a lot of opportunities to work together but even so, we rarely talked heart-to-heart.  
  
But that changed after our first training camp. We were so exhausted on the way back but we didn’t sleep since we ended up chatting instead. It started from idle small talk to how hard the training camp was, then eventually to us encouraging each other to hang in there.  
  
It was really fun spending the entire one and a half hour train ride back to Sendai like that. I think that's when I started getting taken in by her and it made me want to talk to her more.  

**\-- You won't really know someone until you spend time with them. I think this is the case of an unfavorable first impression complicating your friendship with someone.**  

EA: Exactly. That happens to me a lot. Actually, I think I talk to Kaya the most out of the everyone now. I really enjoy being with her.  

OK: Hehehe.

**\-- Now it's your turn, Okuno-san.**  

OK: It’s hard to top that after being praised that much. hehe... Let's see... I think I talk to her the most as well. Ever since that time on the train, she became the member I've been most comfortable being around with.  

EA: Hehe.  

OK: She always gives her all to everything she does. And she's the one who cares about the fans the most. If anything, I want everyone to know that!  

EA: Come on... It's nothing special. hehe.  

\[Airi is more or less the head of the fan club, and a lot of fan-related events and ideas were thought up and managed by her to some degree especially the bus tours, which were entirely her projects.\]  

OK: She and Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu) thought up the entire setlist for the 4th live tour. She has initiative and she thought of many ideas that set us apart from other groups. That's why I think when you come to our live shows, you'll strongly feel Airi's feelings toward WUG.  
  
She's also a really capable producer. She can think up of a lot of good ideas on her own, like during our solo events. She's the type of person who can dedicate herself to making wonderful things happen once she sets her mind to it.  

EA: I feel like my entire being is being praised. Hehe.  

OK: I respect her a lot and I always enjoy talking to her. She has a unique way of words. (laughs)  

EA: You didn't have to bring that up. (laughs)  

OK: I want them to know that about you, though. It’s always an experience chatting with you. It makes me want to be around you all the time.  

EA: Thanks...

**\-- This almost sounds like a love confession.**  

EA: I'm already about to tear up. (laughs) I feel so embarrassed but I'm so happy.  

**\-- By the way, do you hang out together in your free time?**  

EA: We’re both loners. (laughs) We don’t really go out of our way and hang out but we occasionally eat out.  

OK: Like lately after our dubbing sessions for Death March?  

EA: And afterward where we talk to each other on the phone until it’s late? (laughs)  

OK: Yup. Just like that. (laughs)  

**\-- I heard that Eino-san is a Rakuten Eagles fan and Okuno-san is a fan of the Hanshin Tigers. Since you were a guest of _永野愛理が楽天イーグルス愛を大声で必要以上に訴えるイベント_ \[A Rakuten Eagles-sponsored event where Airi invites some of the WUG members to share her appreciation of the Rakuten Eagles\], I assume you got to talk about baseball.**  

OK: We followed the sport at slightly different periods. For me, I stopped right around the first half of the 2010 season.  

EA: I don’t get many chances to talk deeply about baseball but thanks to these opportunities with the Rakuten Eagles, I get to show my excitement about the sport and speculate about my favorite players.  

OK: Right. Most of the time I just listen to her. (laughs) Actually, whenever we have our Rakuten Nighters, we sit next to each other but we all secretly hope to sit next to Airi.  

\[Every Rakuten Nighter, the members who were lucky enough to sit next to Airi were grateful that she was there to commentate and explain the game to them.\]  

EA: Really? I’m glad to hear that!  

OK: I got to sit next to her in 2016 but I haven't gotten lucky since.  

EA: That time, in addition to being my support buddy, she was a great help since she taught me about the history of the players during her time who were still active.  

OK: We have the same way of showing support during games. Instead of going crazy, we just sit quietly and watch the game intently. (laughs)  

**\-- You both sound like expert analysts. (laughs)**  

EA: We’re not the type to get excited and shout. We’re more like the ones who watch carefully and analyze how a certain play might go. We find it really fun that way. (laughs)  

**\--That would make each of you perfect spectating buddies.**  

OK: Koshien (High school baseball tournament) usually gets held around the time of our summer tour. So whenever a game starts, we’re usually at the airport and we look for a TV watch it from.  

EA: Yeah. Then we proceed to talk and speculate about the game as we get into it.  

OK: (Tanaka) Minami’s the type of spectator who gets hyped up at every development. She would shout and cheer beside me while Airi and I would watch intently and be like, “Was that a good play? Ah. Okay.” (laughs)

![](/images/1519825390_1_7_3f1cc7bf51df93f078eb40905cc46f4c.jpg)

**\-- Thank you for talking about each other and your friendship. (laughs) Now, I want to know about your favorite points about WUG.**  

EA: We’re approaching our 5th anniversary but it feels like we've been together much longer than that. Like we’ve known each other for half our lives. We can be ourselves around each other and we get along so well that when we get together, we can be silly and have fun but at the same time share serious moments.  
  
Whenever things get serious, we all chip in with our opinions. Each of us has an idea of what WUG means to us, so there are times when we argue and defend our opinions. But through it all, we know that we all love WUG and that passionate energy is what makes us great.  
  
So even though we’re a group composed of 7 members, no one gets left behind.

**\-- I can definitely see it.**  

EA: They say that when a group has more members, it becomes harder for them to set themselves apart but I don’t think that’s the case with WUG. What I like about us is that the more you know about us, the more our individual qualities shine.  

OK: We have our individual quirks and personalities but none of us wants to overpower anyone. We respect each other and would rather want to elevate one another and this, I feel, makes for a good relationship dynamic.  

**\-- That it does.  How about your fans? What do you like about them?**  

EA: They are so passionate and I think they’re good people. I don’t know why but I feel at ease when they’re around. They’re always there to support us, and while I’m thankful when we interact with them during fan meets, it’s even more so when I see them at other events.  
  
I guess that why I’m always mindful if what we’re doing would make them happy. Such as when we plan for our live shows. We get so anxious to see their reactions.  

**\-- What do you mean by being at ease?**  

EA: We get impressions and opinions from them about our events during fan meets. We get lots of letters about that too. Personally, while we separate each other with labels such as WUG and WUGners, I feel that we’re all in this together.  
  
It’s thanks to their wonderful support that we can push ourselves further so that more people will see our shows and hopefully gain more fans as a result. No matter where or how far apart we seem to be, I love all of them.  

OK: I really feel for our fans, who go all out in supporting us. Just seeing their smiles puts me at ease and encourages me to be better. If I could, I’d send each and every one of them a thank you letter. I’m very very thankful that they’re there for us.  
  
Even when I say something completely nonsensical, they’ll go out of their way and try their hardest to decipher it and tell me about it during meets or in letters. They think about us and I’m glad that they’re earnestly trying to understand who we are.  

\[Kaya does write about a lot of nonsensical things. Aside from the wall and the whale and plankton, there’s her occasional dream diaries, hypothetical inner monologues, and cliffhanger blog posts where she leaves you guessing on what she’s trying to say.\]  

![](/images/1519867857754.jpg)

**\-- Thank you. Moving on, what do you like about** **_Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody_****?**  

EA: If you judge it just by the title, you might think an image of a wounded Satou fighting battle after battle. But he’s actually a kind person. He does get into some fights but it’s more like he found himself in a world that he always wanted to be in.  
  
The anime is a story of him going on an adventure with a band of cute girls. If I could be reborn in that alternate world, I’d also want to be a lovable 2D character.  

**\-- Speaking of which, who is your favorite character?**  

EA: Even if I weren't voicing her, it would have to be Mia. I've always been a fan of characters with twin-tails.  

![](/images/1519867933584.jpg)

**\-- I see. How about you, Okuno-san?**  

OK: The premise makes you think of a harem because the protagonist is surrounded by cute girls. But like I mentioned before, Satou is not into little girls. More like he sees everyone as traveling companions. What I think is interesting is that he really is just a regular guy.  

EA: I agree.  

OK: In episode 5, for example, when Arisa tries to seduce him and he thinks to himself, “Wait! Since when have I ever been into little girls?!” (laughs) And the Yakitori scene \[Satou goes out of his way to provide food for everyone\]. I think it's those aspects that make him trustworthy.  

EA: He's pretty amazing. He's one of those people who can get along well with others and encourage them to help him.

**\-- Who is your favorite character, Okuno-san?**  

OK: I've always liked Tama ever since I saw her when I auditioned. At first, I thought she was a boy because she kind of looked like one but I wasn't sure because she was wearing a skirt.  
  
When I began voicing her, I realized that she's an innocent, free-spirited girl. She has the sharpest instincts out of everyone and her feral side is her best charm. It made me want to adopt her. (laughs)  

\[She wrote in the blog that when she visited her 3 year old niece while the anime was airing, her niece loved the sounds Tama made so Kaya would perform them for her.\]  

![](/images/1519867955087.jpg)

**\-- (laughs). Tama was a surprise for me when she first appeared. I almost forgot that you were voicing her.**  

OK: Really? I appreciate that. Up until the day of the audition, I was actually unsure how to voice her so I just went with my first impression.  

**\-- So that's why!**  

OK: After my audition, I heard from the staff that they found their Tama. It was a shot in the dark but I was glad that they liked it.  

**\-- Now, can you tell me about Mia, Eino-san?**  

EA: Mia was love at first sight. (laughs) I actually auditioned for a different character so it's pretty serendipitous that I ended up voicing her.  
  
Mia doesn't talk that much compared to the other girls but she is quite an expressive girl deep down, that's why there are moments when she lets it all out. I think she's the type of girl who is quite considerate but not necessarily quiet.  

![](/images/1519825390_1_10_638522da6b05ab87ab73378cc3a57fdc.jpg)

**\-- Thank you. Finally, any message you would like to say?**  

OK: Make sure to listen to _SHIFT_. It has a different mood compared to our other songs and unlike _Suki no Skill_, which has an otherworldly feel to it, it's more grounded with Tokyo as its setting. It tells a story of girls who want to audition and some of the lyrics actually feels too real for us. (laughs) Both songs are a fun listen and don't forget to watch the music video!  

EA: Both songs showcase a new and different side of WUG and hopefully our fans get to see that. I also hope that those who bought the single because of the anime will get to know us  
  
The anime is currently airing so let's enjoy it together!  

**\--Thank you for your excellent responses for this interview!**
