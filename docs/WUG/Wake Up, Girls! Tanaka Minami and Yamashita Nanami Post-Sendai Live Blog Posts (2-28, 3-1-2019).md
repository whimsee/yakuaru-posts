This is a little out-of-order but as an extra I decided to publish here some of the translated blog posts the members wrote after their final tour stop in Sendai that I originally posted in the [WUG Discord](https://discord.gg/eQz3fjm). SSA Final Live might be their final show but they always considered their Sendai stop to be their final live so I feel it's just as important to get out there their thoughts about it and their sentiments about the then-approaching Final Live and disbandment.

Posting both Minami and Nanami since they're both quite short and that's it for this series of posts.

Good evening, Minami here.

There goes _Ikeshii_.

\[Ikeshii = Cool Mayushii; a persona Mayu started to develop over time in WUG in contrast to the demure, shy persona she shows most of the time. She calls her this the most probably because Mayu was the one who named her "Minyami".\]

Our show in Sendai wrapped up last weekend and, with it, our final tour. We did 33 shows and we managed to pull it off without incident!! Wow! That's pretty wild!! That's probably something I'll never forget for the rest of my life…!!

When our disbandment was decided, all we wanted to do was vent out our sorrows so we went all out and envisioned Part 1 as a fun party, Part 2 would be where we'd pull off everything we've yet to do as WUG, then conquer that feeling and show everyone we're the the best in Part 3!!

It was the busiest 8 months of my life that it almost felt like I lived through a few years.

Mayushii put in a lot of ideas related to homecoming in her Part 3 pre-show narrations and we were able perform all four of our new songs in Sendai! I'm also pretty glad that we got to show off how we developed our older performances. We brought umbrellas for _Higawari Princess_, and used the stairs for _Kotonoha Aoba_ and _Shizuku no Kanmuri_. ♪ It was great!

The Tohoku Princesses were so beautiful. :) :)

Aichan handled the planned segment and it was so cool! I've been a huge fan of her dancing since I started taking dance lessons. It's so elegant and precise with no wasted movements. I can't get enough of it.

I learned a lot watching her rehearse for her solo event. I even recorded videos which I reviewed countless times since you don't usually witness that level of talent. She oversaw my progress as our de-facto dance leader and she's always ready to lend an ear when there's something I couldn't get. I love all the songs she did the cheography for just as much her uncompromising dance style!!

I wanted to say all of that during the show but was too long and too hard to put into words so I decided to write it here instead.  
  
It's because of that I felt so ecstatic for her that she finally got to dance in Sendai! She also performed her solo event songs, which I adore. It was so different from my initial impression. So full of emotion and power, I felt overwhelmed. All in all, that segment was Airi through and through.

By the way, that intermission during Heartline was totally Kaya's idea!

「時が経ち 新しい未来で いつかまた出会えるはずだよ」

\[Rough: _Time will pass and we'll meet again someday in a new future_. (Lyrics from _Heartline_)\]

Yoppi and I were facing each other during this part and I just teared up! No, I cried! Damn it! But thanks anyway for picking the song for Sendai!

![](/images/o1478110814363405893.jpg)

It's just as Yoppi said, sadness hits you harder the more fun you have. I know it sounds contradictory but it's true! It just descends on you all at once when it's over. That's exactly why I want to finish with no regrets and face my greatest fear: Expressing my current feelings through song.

I always manage to perform songs in the same manner it gets recorded. I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing especially in this industry but in live shows, it's pretty cool if the audience gets to experience something different. Live shows have a life of its own. That's what's fun about them and the tour reinforced that thought!

The tour kept building momentum as it went along until it finally exploded in Sendai. lol. It was a huge release of excitement that I ended up crying. It was embarrassing… It's been a long time since but it kinda just happened and my tears started flowing in the middle of the show! But since it's the final show, I did manage to end with a smile.

I'm so glad we ended the tour in Sendai. I wouldn't have felt this deep of an attachment to Sendai and Tohoku if it weren't for WUG, and I think I can say the same for the countless WUGners who have gone to Tohoku because of us!

We want to go back there even after we disband. As we've said in our MC, never forget about WUG, that we were "there", that so many people loved WUG.  
  
If time permits, I'll find myself back there again, especially Isinomaki to give my thanks to the place and Grandma Isokawa \[Reference to Minyami-chan's hometown and the grandma who inspired her to pursue becoming an idol\].  
  
Minami and I will do our best in SSA and onward!

Thank you always for the flowers and letters! They're my source of power! lol.

**Nanami Blog (3-1-2019)**

Good going this week, everyone!  
Nanami here. ♪

Our HOME Tour was a huge success!!!

![](/images/o1478110814364721049.jpg)

I'm going to write about the growth I realized in myself over the past week.

Our tour went on for 33 shows and once the final show ended, it almost felt like a gaping hole opened up in my heart that just now filled itself to bursting. Thank you WUGners for all the love! That alone made everything enjoyable and fun as we overcame the challenges that came with the tour. And that night in Sendai, all of us, the members, staff, all of you, achieved the three types of happiness!

\[Reference to the three types of people according to the anime: 1. Those who can make everyone happy. 2. Those who are happy if they can make the people closest to them happy. 3. Those who will eventually feel happiness as long as they've made someone happy.\]

When I first heard about the notion during our WUG dubbing sessions, I used to believe that it's something I can achieve on my own but I was competely wrong. WUG's story resonates with me a lot and it was Mayu's final words that made me rethink and realize that, much like Hisami Nanami realized herself, that I can't achieve that alone.

Airi did a video for her planned segment. It showed messages from people in Sendai who have given us support over the years and I wouldn't have imagined the amount of support back when we started. Airi wrote about it on her blog so check that out. Thank you so much, Tohoku. I will go there again someday.

We did 33 live shows since the tour started in July and we showed time and time again that it's not over yet for WUG and we will carry that momentum right up to our show in SSA!

That said, I also know through letters and messages that so many WUGners will be lonely and sad to see us go… and I'm concerned because I feel that they are not alone. We will be around as well as the WUGners who have been supporting us. Just like Kaya said, "It's all right not to accept it." All we ask is to never forget because I won't.

We're putting all our effort into this final show, this parade of memories, and we aim to exceed all your expectations. I'll sweep away all your concerns and anxieties so that everyone, and I mean everyone, sees us off with a smile!!

Oh no… I finally said it! But I'm all fired up now!!! Let's do this!!!

\[Announcements: Nonsugar getting the top spot in チーム対抗スペシャル大会, Tiktok videos, Animebeans thing with Mayu, an Osomatsu-san event, Hackadoll-3 is starting a twitter\]

And that's all! Thank you for reading. （＾Ｏ＾）

again&again, see you next time~!

\[Nanami explained "again&again" after Tokushima live. It means that she wants each and every encounter to be significant, that once wouldn't be enough, that you'd want to see her again and again.\]
