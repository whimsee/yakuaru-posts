## [Wake Up, Girls！@吉岡茉祐](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12445601345.html)

* * *

This is hard. Where should I begin? Who would have thought ending a blog that went on for five and a half years would be this difficult.

Is this really the end? I still feel like there's more after this.... I should understand this more than anyone but here I am, searching for remote possibilities proving it otherwise. I guess it hasn't fully sunk in yet, though that day had already come and gone. Maybe my heart hasn't caught up yet

I wonder if it'll ever happen. Little by little, as my memory slowly fades, maybe that would be the time.

I don't want to forget.

If I don't truly feel it, maybe I won't forget it. I have to accept it but I don't want to forget. If only there was a way to take the memory of that view and perfectly preserve it, not missing a single second... That spectacular view. A fantastic memory. A memory I want to keep forever.

Good evening. This is Yoshioka Mayu.  
  
I've been reading all your impressions on twitter. I'm glad the hashtag we thought up, [#WUG\_SSA](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23wug_ssa), trended the way it did. It kept going non-stop that it's hard to follow everything. I complain but I'm glad. Then I thought about having to go to sleep and I was out the moment I closed my eyes. lol. It was noon by the time I woke up. Late morning, me.

Actually, my body's all beat up. My neck is sore and I can't move my legs though I had a nice long sleep... But after all the shouting I did, my voice is still good. Huh? It still works. lol It's my primary tool as a voice actress so of course it won't give out that easily. lol. and it's all thanks to WUG.

That said, I can't be reckless so I'll rest for today. 

Oh, my room's a mess... It's been that way since I got back but I don't want to move. lol

"I'll do it tomorrow"

"Only people who procrastinate say that."

"Just let me be for today. lol"

I guess there won't be any WUG activities starting tomorrow... I guess I won't be saying "That's it!" the same way starting tomorrow...

Matsuda-san, Tange-san, and Hayasaka-san's narration really hit me... No doubt they welcomed the stage for us...

Well then, why don't I recall yesterday's events.  

I would like to say again, thank you for coming to our final live. Thank you so much. I say that as well to those who couldn't come. Thank you to everyone who knows about us.

Our dream stage. Our promised place. Saitama Super Arena.

I dreamed of a time where our fans would fill its seats. Thank you for making that happen. Each and every one of you made that sight as perfect as it is, forming a view that's more impactful than its individual pieces combined.

The show was full of memories that I want to talk about.

**<Tachiagare>**  

Our first song. An original song made just for us.

It reminds of the time we recorded it, not knowing how anything worked, and when our group was first revealed.

Shouting "Tachiagare!" with everyone will always reverberate in my heart and that last one was legendary

**<16-Sai no Agape>**

The smile Airi had during our high five was the brightest I've ever seen from her. It reassured me that we'll be fine and we can enjoy rest of the day.

We conveyed all our love to you and we heard you all shouting our names!  

**<7 Girls War>**

It always hypes me up whenever we huddle and shout "_Ikuzo, Ganbappe, Wake Up, Girls!_"

It's like getting together for one last boost before the big battle, where emotions are pitted against another.

Our showcase intermission went well too!

**<Yukimoyou Koi no Moyou>**

Performing this while wearing school uniforms reminds me of our stage play, one of our turning points.

The cast members came to watch so I hope it reached them as well.  

**<Kotonoha Aoba>**

This song gives emphasis in relying on the notion of "Working hard". For WUG, it's not that simple. We also faced ourselves earnestly.

I wonder, when was the first time we did the choreography with the girls sending their feelings to me...

Their smiles this time were beautiful.

**<One in a Billion>**

Thank you for the encounter, May'n. Thank you for appreciating us and making WUM a reality. Thank you for all the advice and all the fun times we shared.

That's why the white spotlight we shone on stage was filled with our feelings of gratitude. I'm glad it reached you.

It was a miraculous encounter in this big world. You were the magic ingredient that spiced up the view we were used to seeing.

I'm grateful for the once-in-a-lifetime encounter!!!

**<Sugao de KISS ME>**

What a way to kick up the mood. lol

This song's energy never lets up. The way the rhythm echoes in my body along with the ever-intensifying calls hypes me up so much.

This is the black counterpart to BTB's white and sacred atmosphere, and I always look forward to hearing Yoppi's deep and intense singing,

**<Koi? de ai? de boukun desu!>**

I am grateful that we got to work on this anime. I don't think we would have done a song as cute as this without it.

Thank you also, Guri-chan.   
  

**<Hajimaru>**

My first character song. I only did one part but it was fun as it lead to everyone else's. The part I sang undoubtedly came from Shimada Mayu, a girl who is too serious and awkward, but compassionate and resolute.

Moreover, it's a great song.

**<Non Stop Diamond Hope>**

It's our last time to sing this as a group so we did the chorus!  
  
I didn't expect it would actually happen... Hopefully, the message conveyed in our medley reached our respective characters. 

Shine bright, wherever you are!  

**<WUG Zoo Zoo>**

It's fun singing and dancing with everyone!

And this is just from a spinoff series where we just goof off...

I think most of the audience is doing the motions now and I'm glad!!

**<HIGAWARI PRINCESS>**

Only for today, we're all princesses!

The individual versions have their own appeal but the seven princess version was just as good.

What's great about the song is that it has different versions emphasizing a different member by making them the center.  

**<Suki no Skill>**  

I know a lot of people who love this song.

The outfits are cute. The center, Kaya, is as well. The song itself is different from our usual mood starting from the intro.

Our tie-up songs have a lot of unique appeal to them.   
  
This song also has ballet moves, which bring me back... and it has a homely melody that's soothing as we dance to it.  
  

**<Bokura no Frontier>**

Our first tie-up song.

Thank you Minami for pushing us forward during that time when we didn't know what to do.

Watching Nanami's beautiful smile from my angle as she readies herself for her line always puts me at ease 

**<7 Senses>**

It's our promised place, after all.

For a song that has a lot of calls to us, I think everyone's shown a whole new expression for this stage.  
  
7 senses. 7 personalities.

Our personalities are all over the place but it became WUG's greatest asset. This song proves it.

**<Gokujou Smile>**

What's strange about this song is that it makes anyone smile, no matter what they're feeling and the best part about it is the amount of calls it has.

We've performed it it in so many festa events and anyone who sings it ends up smiling until eventually everyone is smiling. And the smiles that day were as great as it always was.

Let's overcome the trying moments and face what's next with our best smiles from now until forever! 

**<Shizuku no Kanmuri>**

This song can be interpreted in so many ways, so my first impression was that it was difficult.

It also reminded me how hard it is to sing ballads since the last one where I did the closing line was _Kotonoha Aoba_  

**<Shoujo Koukyoukyoku>**

It's encouraging how the calls for this song slowly build up.

The way Yoshino builds herself up for our solo with me always makes me want to take out my earpiece so I can hear it directly.

We did great that time, how we faced each other, held hands and gripped it tightly, as if we're giving kudos to each other. It gave me goosebumps.  

**<Beyond the Bottom>**

The heart shouts. The soul resonates.  
  
I don't think there will be another song that will fit those words perfectly... Even the song by itself, without the words, without having to sing it, can shake anyone's heart.

The moment I heard "_WUG Saikou!_" and we rushed to the center, it felt like a dream that felt too real that I don't want to wake up from.

I don't even remember what happened after that. lol

But I know I was able to sing happily from the bottom of my heart!

**<Umi Soshite Shutter Doori>**    

The song expresses our feelings to Tohoku and our respective hometowns and we sang it imagining the sceneries of those places.

The people I worked with for the "Kihaku" stage play came to watch so I also wanted them to hear this song.

\[Note: The stage play is about the Tohoku Earthquake\]

It may be a new song but it carries a powerful message and melody, and we were finally able to convey that properly that day.

**<Kotoba no Kesshou>**

I get so into the dance when it starts that I lost myself to it.

One thing I'm proud of in our final tour was how we incorporated theatrical elements to it, especially the lights.

**<Doyoubi no Flight>**

I wonder if you all have flown on a plane before...

When I was singing this song, I thought of it as the day after March 8, which added weight to the lyrics.

"Don't forget but forget it well. I'm frustrated and scared. I want to cry. That's how bad it is." \[Roughly translated lyrics from the song\]  

**<Sayounara no Parade>**

Singing this brought back so many memories. I can never get used to saying goodbye, I don't like it so hopefully you can forgive me for that.

But I have to accept it, that's what we all feel. That there's still more after this and we have to keep going!

Our curtain call at the end along with the heartfelt applause... being able to do that with the girls is an honor.

It was the best parade one could ask for.  

**<SHIFT>**

A song this lively is also our staple and getting this done perfectly during the tour is something we're proud of.

The way we used the chairs and stairs in the performance was appropriate to the glamorous atmosphere it portrays.

And listening to it will make anyone feel that a good day is coming.

**<Chikatetsu Labyrinth>**

It's refreshing to see Miyu run about the trolley that I found myself doing the same. lol

The Trolley Labyrinth was fun!

And I think I can owe the tour for how well everyone did the rap with us.  

**<TUNAGO>**

Kaya's words hit it home.

We will never forget Tohoku. Especially March. That month is full of memories.

Even without WUG, given the chance, we all want to go to Tohoku again, and perhaps we might see the fruits of our efforts.

There are things we will never forget and with a gentle heart, each and every one of us are connected.

**<Polaris>**

All the things we want to say contained in a song.

"A single speck of light, earnestly wishing for an ideal world to the stars above."

When I wrote those words, I never expected it to ever come true. Being on a stage overlooking a sea of lights, with the girls smiling beside me.

I don't ever want to wake up from it. If only this dream could keep going forever.

But if we have time to reminisce, we should use it to move forward.

Thank you so much for being the light that guides our way and I hope the glittering memories of that show leaves a place in your heart for years to come.

* * *

I want to extend this gratitude to all our songs. Thank you for being our pillar of support.

Thank you for those who worked on them. Thank you for giving us the honor of singing them.

Thank you for giving us a place to grow.

I was able to enjoy singing and it opened a world full of possibilities. I would have been a shame if I passed on without realizing it.

And for that, I'm very glad.

I also want to thank our choreographers for all the wonderful dances. I don't know a lot of songs that I enjoy dancing to, but thanks to WUG, I realized how much I enjoy singing and dancing live.

Thank you for all the flowers

(For the last few, I left out the ones addressed to all the members, sorry! but I saw all of them. Thank you!)  
  
Also, there were a lot of outfits we wanted to wear so...

[![](/images/mayu16.jpg)](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/image-12445601345-14369172231.html)

From our school outfit to memorial, we couldn't fit everything in but we changed a lot! lol

They all carry so many memories, we wanted to give them our gratitude.

To our outfitters, thank you for all the cute outfits.

To our make up artists, thank you for always making us look nice.

You're always there for us during break as our sister and mother figures. Always ready to bring up the mood.

Thank you.

Of course, to our managers and staff who always look out for us, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

* * *

Thank you for coming to the rehearsal. I'm glad we did it, really!

We were unbelievably nervous before the show that we were terrified to be on stage. But we did for the rehearsal and we were able to visualize how the real thing would be.

Your calls reassured us that it will be alright. That we'll be ready to face a full venue.

We did _Tomaranai Mirai_ and _Little Challenger_, both songs exclusive to the rehearsal. I'm glad that in this way, we got to give our thanks to the I-1 Club songs and the help they've given us.

I'm sorry we never got to talk properly during the send-off. If we tried to speak, our tears might have started flowing and never stop.

But your feelings reached us.

Let's make this Chapter 2 a good one!  

To our fanclub members, thank you so much!

* * *

I should stop here but there's still something to reminisce. I don't feel fully conscious and ah... here comes the tears. My eyes are already puffy so it can't get any worse. But there is one important thing I want to show and here it is...  

[![](/images/mayu17.jpg)](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/image-12445601345-14369172697.html)

I started this notebook on March 22, 2013 as my diary for our first training camp. It lasted ten days. Reading through this, I can see I haven't found myself yet I was trying my hardest to do so. Yoppi wasn't there on the first day so it was just six of us. Actually, I wasn't an official member then but the others were. This was to be my final audition. So on the second day, I wrote about my impressions about the other members.

For Kaya, "Strong elder sister vibe, but top-level airhead."

For Nanami, "Very excitable and her dialect is comforting."

For Miyu... I wrote her as "miyumiyu"!!! She didn't have a proper nickname yet...

It was A-rin for Airi... But thinking about it now, it doesn't suit her at all!!! lol

I guess this was the day I started calling Minami "Minyami"... I even wrote that she reminds me of cats. lol

And even though I haven't known her then, I called Yoshino "Yoppi-chan" lol It was after this that our well-known fight happened and I had no idea... So I wrote that I couldn't wait to meet her.

Oh yeah, I also wrote about myself here and tried the name "Mayushii" 

On the final day as I was about to be inducted as a member, I wrote:

"I want to grow with them. We'll all drift apart but I want to be their rival, a friend they want to compete with."  

I guess I've always thought that way since then. So let me say that I did become that person.

And so on April 1, I was officially welcomed to WUG.

My 6 years in WUG and the various hardships I faced gave me strength. Overcoming each trial made me stronger and made possible things that only we can do. I became strong because of WUG and I'm glad that I started with WUG. I'm grateful I got to work with the girls.  

Miyu, you're smart, confident and good with electronics. You have the traits of a proper adult. But the satisfied look you have whenever you eat and the moments where you act as a spoiled child always make me smile.

Nanami, you're in a world all to yourself, and you seemed worried about how you're so unreserved about it and that you have a one-of-a-kind voice. But I look up to how you turned all those into your strengths.  

Minami, in the six years I've known you, the look you have when you're seriously mad and trying not to be rude told me that you're someone I can completely trust. So even now, you're someone I look up to and rely on.

Airi, your strong and determined nature has never changed since we first met. You're the most mature of us all and I admire your boundless patience. I guess that's why I always run to you whenever I feel like giving up.  

Kaya, I completely misjudged you that I regret having that first impression. There's so much about you that's great and it's crazy that there's a lot of things that only you can do. I'm jealous that you understand yourself better than anyone. A mature lady at heart.  

Yoshino, it sounded strange when you told me you hate me with that pleased expression on your face, but I changed because of that. I'm grateful from the bottom of my heart that we competed together as center and leader. WUG has no leader other than you.  

* * *

I achieved something precious. Something reassuring that being simply being a voice actress wouldn't give. Meeting Shimada Mayu was one of those. I was able to find myself and what I can do thanks to WUG.  

I wrote in my diary, "Who do I want to be?"

Back then I answered, "It's my dream to become a voice actress. I also want to be on stage. I want to study acting. And once I get older, much older, I've accomplished so many things, I can live normally. Actually, I'm also interested in behind-the-scenes production work so maybe I'll do that once I get older... or maybe I'm getting too ahead of myself. So for now I'll take it one step at a time."  

Hmm... That hasn't changed a bit. lol

I guess I aspired to be someone multi-talented right at the very start. lol

I want to keep chasing this unchanging dream. I'll achieve my all my wants, hopes and dreams head on. I will make them real. WUG showed me that I can.  

* * *

There's so much I want to write. I don't want to stop! I mean, 6 years is a lot to take in. lol

I'm not completely sad as I write this post because I know we'll see each other again. Yeah, it's not like we're going to disappear.

The girls and I may have gone our separate ways but that doesn't mean we'll never meet again. We'll probably run into each other at a studio at some point. Maybe a radio show. Or even a stage play. And who knows where else.  

I'll be starring in an anime that will come out in summer and I'll show everyone the things I learned as a voice actress as I take this new step.

I also have a video program where I get to read your thoughts and impressions!

It's all fun times from here and there will be new memories to share and reminisce!

I'm also starring in a stage play and through acting, I get to show different sides of myself.

Through my weekly column, you'll still be able to read my writing, much like what I've done for this blog.

Thanks to Sendai Television and their program, I get to go to Tohoku!

These wonderful connections link me to you and those won't go away. They will continue and it's our turn to prove that this was not in vain.

* * *

Passing it on is difficult but let our story stay in your memory.

Don't forget.

Until the day we meet again with our best smiles.  
What happens to Wake Up, Girls is up to you!!!!
