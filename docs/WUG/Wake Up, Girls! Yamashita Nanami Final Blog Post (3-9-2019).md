WUG’s Final Live, _Parade of Memories_, was a huge success!

Thank you so much for coming.

March 8… I never thought a specific day could mean so much to me. Every moment, every song… I just wanted to savor every bit as much as I could.

I imagine our fans felt the same way too ^^!   
It’s the final show, after all! Nothing comes after this and everyone—me, the girls, and the audience—knew what it meant.

One might say that these situations happen all the time in life but the sadness I felt was unmistakably real. That said, we accomplished something only the seven of us could. Something that could have only been possible thanks to six years we shared together.

And I don’t think many people can say something like that with pride. Just like Mayushii said, we really are the best.

When I asked if there were any first-timers in the audience, it made me so glad to hear such a strong response! There were people who wanted to go to our final show. Who would go there no matter what. Who would invite or bring their friends just to see us.

It’s because of you that we filled SSA end-to-end with so many lights. It was breathtaking ◎!!!

Thank you so much!

I took in that sight not feeling particularly sad, instead accepting that our time as a group was ending.

From our 33-show _HOME Tour_,  
the surprise at _Anisama_,  
the three-song collaboration challenge at _Animax Musix_,  
the love everyone showed us at _WUGRISRUN_,  
to Washizaki-san inviting all of us to his show,  
the documentary that ran for 4 months,  
and that incredible sight at SSA...

Seeing our fans expressing so much love and passionate support as we step it up each and every show encouraged us as well as the staff to give it our all until the end. And hearing comments that we’ve shown our best yet in every show makes me happy and proud of how loved we truly are.

Really, thank you so much!!

To the girls,  
It’s amazing we even wound up together!  
It has to be a miracle. We came from all over from faraway places and it’s funny thinking that it would be people like that who I’ll find myself sharing and overcoming trial after trial!  
You’ll always have a place in my heart. The years we had are proof of that.  
Thank you so much for everything!

I should probably finish this here.

To our fans, thank you from the bottom of my heart!! I feel so fortunate to have met and shared all those experiences with you! I love you all as well! ^^ When the girls and I find each other again once we grow old, we hope to see you there too, happy and healthy in your own way. (＾ｰ^)☆彡

We’ve chosen our own paths moving forward. We’ll be waiting for you!
