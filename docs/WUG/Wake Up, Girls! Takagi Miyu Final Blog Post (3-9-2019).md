## [**Keep Smilling.(み´μ｀ゆ)**](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-12445608706.html)

I was up all night yesterday reading [#WUG\_SSA](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wug_ssa&src=typd). It went trending the whole day and kept going by the time I woke up that I felt how momentous it all was. We also received so many messages from people we worked with, telling us so many good things, and I left in tears as I read through them and the whole day went just like that.  

My eyes are still puffy as I write this!  

Miyu here.  (●´μ｀●)  

Yesterday, we finally reached our biggest stage. Saitama Super Arena. Wake Up, Girls! Parade of Memories!

My heart is full to bursting, it's hard to put my feelings into words. But what I can say is that I'm so glad that I became part of WUG!!!

On standby while watching the opening video.

A view made up of 13,000 WUGners. It was very touching to be welcomed by it and our anime opening as we wore our school outfits. T\_T

Sendai, our hometown, now and forever.

KISS ME with a twist. ;)

I love how everyone switched their colors to who was near them, regardless of their favorite, as we went around.

Greetings from under the walkway. \\/\\/

We went to the audience so many times!!! I saw each and every one of your smiles! :) It goes without saying our smiles were also the brightest it had ever been!    

![](/images/f9bc53b7f57dad98c2c99e19c6428f80.jpg)

WUG is the best! Final stretch! I love it that even with our new songs, we could hear everyone calling out to us through our earpieces. :)

Encore! We still have a long way to go. Lesson! Lesson!

Double encore! Completely surrounded by stars during Polaris! \*

Thank you for staying for the triple encore! T\_T

Welcomed our second chapter with a smile with Tachiagare!

Also! Each of us wrote letters that we read on stage for our final introduction. We only had so much time so I did my best and put what I could and here it is!

\[It is better experienced than read. Look forward to the blu-ray but I will post a translation at a later post. She thanked everyone who came. She thanked everyone who supported them and brought them this far. And thanked them again and again. She finally thanked the girls who were with her all the way. She said that these memories will serve as her motivation for the future and she's hoping for everyone's support from here on.\]  

I hope my feelings of gratitude reached you. I'll bring those feelings with me as a pillar of support moving forward! I also specifically chose a stationary with a rainbow drawing for the occasion!  

Thank you for pouring your heart to us through your letters! They always give me strength.  

Thank you for all who came yesterday!

We also did a public rehearsal! Seeing our fanclub members before the real show took all the nerves away! Thank you! I'm glad you came for the send-off so I can also see you off with a smile!

Thank you for all the love you sent through flowers! I took pictures of them all! I did my best to organize them so I'm sorry if I happen to miss any...!

I can't wait to talk about SSA in Nobinyoki and -Mairaji! Maybe even in Isshoni Granblue since Emiri-san also went! I was touched by the amount of messages and flowers the I-1 cast sent us. T\_T  

For those planning to send messages through my radio shows, I'll be happy to accept them. (We're recording -Mairaji soon so please send them sooner!)

I hope you keep watching them.  

Also, don't forget to read the super long interviews we did for Famitsu, and don't miss the special collaboration program we did between Ganbappe Radio and WUG channel for SSA. You can watch it for free here. [https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/1552012143](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/1552012143)

We also received flowers from Wake Up, Mothers! (Our moms)

We gathered and had lunch with them before the show! Thank you for bringing us into this world! T\_T T\_T T\_T

Even though we've disbanded, the bonds we shared will live on forever, which means the work we've done and our songs will live on as well.  

My dreams were realized thanks to WUG! All of this is proof of it and an experience that I will bring with me!

I hope that when things aren't going well, that you think of us and find yourself back on your feet! Because we're never truly alone! We're always connected to each other as we live our lives. So always be grateful for those around you!  

So as you go forward, do your best to live as earnestly and honestly as you can and your dreams will come true! And I hope that my ever-radiant smile reaches you wherever you are!  

Let's meet again with our best smiles!

That is all! Good nighty night!  ☆ノシ
