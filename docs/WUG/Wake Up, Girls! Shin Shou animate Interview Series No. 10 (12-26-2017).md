**What makes a WUG song? A chat with \[Wake Up, Girls!\] x \[MONACA\] and their production process.**

**\--- Hirokawa-san, as the one who made _Yukimoyou Koi no Moyou_** **and _Bokura no Frontier_****, can I ask which aspects you focus on when you create music?**

**Hirokawa Keiichi (Hirokawa):** Well, I guess you could say I worked on them...

**Aoyama Yoshino (Yoppi):** He also did _Higawari Princess_.

**Tanaka Hidekazu (Tanaka):** _Tunago_, as well.

**Hirokawa:** Since we've been working with WUG for a long time, rather than focusing on a certain aspect, we instead made music for them the way that felt appropriate. Lately though, I've been wanting to try something new but not anything out of the ordinary since there is still a fine balance to consider.

That said, I made _Yukimoyou Koi no Moyou_ (first introduced in WUG’s first stage play, _Aoba no Kiroku_) with a bit of a character song vibe. Canonically, it was written at around the same time as Twinkle's _16-sai no Agape_, so I took into consideration what WUG was at the time.

**\--- And you also produced I-1 Club's songs.**

**Hirokawa:** I-1 club's songs have a narrative attached to them. _Kimi to Progress_ was made as a continuation to _Unmei no Megami_ and _Tomaranai Mirai_. In that sense, _Jewelry Wonderland_, which we revealed in _Wake Up, Girls！Festa.2017 TRINITY_ the other day, was a culmination of that.

**Yoshioka Mayu (Mayushii):** I love Suzuki Moka's (CV: Yamamoto Nozomi) singing in _Kimi to Progress_. She was the highlight of that song. (laughs)

**Yoppi:** I-1 Club’s songs have a completely different mood compared to WUG’s.

**Mayushii:** They give off a vibe like it's an ideal to strive for, or a goal that’s just out of reach.

**Yoppi:** _Little Challenger_ feels like it came from a different time.

**Mayushii:** It's like the song is encouraging you to try your hardest and aim for the sky, while _Unmei no Megami_ builds itself up into a strong crescendo, as that you’re making your way to it.

**Hirokawa:** I think we can owe that impression to how well they performed those songs.

\[During _Green Leaves Fes_, they tweeted that the I-1 Club songs are a callback to idol music from the 80s and 90s whereas WUG songs have a more modern pop influence.\]

**\--- This may be difficult to put into words but what makes a song a WUG song?**

**Mayushii:** It is hard to articulate well, but I believe they're quintessentially MONACA songs that they made for us to sing.

**Hirokawa:** Actually, there had been times when other artists approached us to make a song and requested changes to it because it sounds like a WUG song.

**Yoppi:** That happens?!!

**Hirokawa:** Yeah. They seem to notice a distinction.

**Okuno Kaya (Kaya):** I think our songs are really fun and cheerful, especially when combined with our choreography, but I also feel that there's a sense of uncertainty to it. Like there's a hidden dark side that makes it a WUG song.

**Tanaka:** You have a point. There definitely is.

**Mayushii:** Our songs aren't just happy and cheerful all the time.

**Kaya:** Exactly.

**Yoppi:** _Gokujou Smile_ is quite a gloomy song. It has such a cheerful melody but it's about being able to smile in spite of sorrowful moments.

**\--- You mean to say WUG songs contain feelings of sadness?**

**Tanaka:** Not necessarily but a composer imagines how the performer would sing it. They would also carefully consider how that song could be emotionally moving. Just like Kaya mentioned, WUG songs aren't just songs to cheer people up.

When we make a WUG song, we want it to be more than that. We want to make a song that represents what WUG is all about. (asks Hirokawa-san) Does that work for you?

**Hirokawa:** It does, though I think the word I'd use is emotional?

**Tanaka:** It sounds so simple if you put it that way. (laughs)

**Hirokawa:** How about passionate emotions? It does have that aspect to it.

**Tanaka:** We made the background music for the anime, so we knew everything about the story. I guess, by then, we already had some idea as to what kind of music the group will have.

**Mayushii:** We had no knowledge of the recording process and I didn’t have much experience singing in front of people. MONACA wrote our music when we debuted and I think the time we worked together since then contributed a great deal. We have a lot of trust and confidence in each others’ abilities, and because of that, we can lose ourselves to our songs, even talk about them like this.

**\--- I see.**

**Tanaka:** She's not with us today but Airi Eino contributed quite a bit. She often played the tambourine for us. We asked her to play in _7 Senses_ and a few other songs.

\[She is officially credited in _7 Senses_ and _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_ for the tambourine.\]

**Hirokawa:** Did she bring her tambourine for _7 Senses_?

**Tanaka:** No. It was on short notice that day, and we already requested one for the studio. It has a really nice sound.

**Hirokawa:** She did bring her own for _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_. She told us she played it on the train on the way going there.

**Mayushii:** And since then, the tambourine became a staple.

**\--- In the anime, Hayasaka-san (CV: Suzumura Kenichi) often pushes the girls to try new things. In _Shin Shou_, it was to create lyrics for a song. Were there things you’ve been meaning to try for WUG’s unit songs?**

**Tanaka:** Trying wouldn't be the word I'd use. It would imply it's something we've been challenging ourselves to accomplish for a long time. We may have mentioned something along these lines before but it's not about making something familiar, it's making something fresh.

**Hirokawa:** There’s also their vocal ranges to consider as well.

**Tanaka:** As the songs become more complicated and we become experienced, we ended up adding parts that weren’t usually part of WUG unit songs until then.

To give a concrete example, Yoppi's falsetto in _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_. We wrote that knowing that there was someone who can do it. That was because of the time we did her solo song.

**Yoppi:** _Stella Drive_...

**Tanaka:** I try not to be demanding but I wanted to try something out, and Yoppi did her best to keep up. In the end, it turned out so well, we decided to add the falsetto part in _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_.

That being said, solo songs are light on choreography. Since it was a group song, that falsetto would have come in as they dance and sing while keeping formation. So there is a difference in terms of difficulty between group and solo songs, but we tried it anyway because I believed Yoppi can pull it off.

[\[According to a tweet by Tanaka Hidekazu, the found the right key (Hi D#) for Yoppi's falsetto from Stella Drive's outro.\]](https://twitter.com/MONACA_tanaka/status/694181967466622976)

**Hirokawa:** I was worried if they could sing a fast song. But after seeing them perform it live, I can say that they did it perfectly, even with the choreography, intense as it was. I could really see how much they practiced for it.

**Yoppi:** Hirokawa-san, having seen us perform live, what is your favorite song?

**Hirokawa:** I really like _Bokura no Frontier_. I began to appreciate it a lot more when I saw it live. It has a bit of a unique feel to it, and it gets you really pumped up once you hear that slow 4-beat buildup before the vocals come in. It's one of those performances where you can't just look away.

**Mayushii:** _Bokura no Frontier_ is a tie-up song separate from WUG. At first, we were very concerned about the idea of doing one but that went away when we heard the Hirokawa-san's demo. It feels very "us", and I'm very grateful that it's a song we could sing as ourselves.

Hirokawa: Thank you.

**\--- In _Shin Shou_, it was announced that the unit is going write the lyrics for one of the songs.**

**Mayushii:** Right. (To Tanaka-san) What was your honest opinion about it?

**Tanaka:** To be honest, I wasn't sure you could pull it off.

**All three girls:** But our characters did...

**Tanaka:** I was really wasn't confident if you could do it. This might sound a little harsh but I did have my concerns when I first heard about it.

**Mayushii:** Ah. That's understandable.

**Tanaka:** Because there are professional lyricists in the music industry. If we asked them to write for us, it’s guaranteed we'll get something worth using. So I was definitely worried but it surprised me in the end because you were able to do a good job. (laughs)

**Mayushii:** Thank you. There was a scene in _Shin Shou EP 3 (I Am My Ponytail)_ where Nanase Yoshino was being offered a modeling gig, and Tange-san said, "If we say no, an I-1 member will take your place."

Someone else would have taken over if we didn't take the opportunity. While I hoped to see how a professional would tackle it, we saw it as a challenge. So after thinking it over for about a week, we decided to give it a shot.

**Tanaka:** It's the same situation in Shin Shou where the girls were tasked with providing the lyrics. There is a difference though, that being the tight schedule creating the suspense.

**Yoppi:** That's true!

**Tanaka:** Now that we're on the topic, who thought of the title "Polaris"?

**Yoppi:** Mayushii and Minami did.

**Mayushii:** When we were deliberating on a theme, we eventually arrived on “stars”, since it was a thing in the anime. We followed that lead and somehow, by pure coincidence, Minami and I arrived at the same word for the title. So in a sense, the title decided what came next because ideas continued to flow from everyone after that.

\[According to the blog, another interview, and Five Stars (2018/3/28), “Polaris” happened at Haneda airport while they were waiting for their flight to LAX for Anisong World Matsuri. Mayu, Minami, and Yoppi were bouncing ideas around, and the topic of stars came up and Minami googled the word and came across Polaris, which sounded cool to her. At the same time, Mayu thought of the word herself.\]

**Tanaka:** Ah. That's nice.

**Mayushii:** I imagine professional lyricists have a completely different approach. We haven't done it before as a group, and we have no idea how they would do it. Yet, we ended up piecing one together. It's a little surreal. (laughs)

\[At this point, Mayu has already written lyrics for a song, Tegami, which was her 2017 Solo Event song. She would eventually write _Polaris_ (with input from the other members), _Gloria_, and _Sweet Sweet Place_, the latter two as her 2018 Solo Event songs.\]

**Tanaka:** Regardless of experience, it had to be a difficult task. It's not just taking ideas and piecing words together. But you surpassed my expectations so I was pleasantly surprised that you pulled it off.

**Mayushii:** Thank you very much for the kind words.

**Tanaka:** For better or for worse, I'm sure a professional lyricist would have written it with different tone and phrasing. But the fact that you wrote it yourselves gives those lyrics a special personal charm to it.

**Yoppi:** If feels so nice to be complimented...

**Mayushii:** ♪ Homeraretenobiteku~ ♫ (Line from _7 Senses_)  \[I improve when I’m praised\]

\*Everyone laughs\*

**Mayushii:** I think every song is handled differently. When you write lyrics, you have to listen to it intently as you work on it but a song can change drastically throughout the whole process, from conceptualization until completion.

**Kaya:** Mayushii oversaw my recording session then we discussed it afterward. While I proposed my own lyrics, Mayushii was the one who consolidated them because someone has to rein everything in. (laughs) We recorded our lines numerous times that it felt kind of embarrassing listening to them.

**Mayushii:** It sure did. (laughs)

**Kaya:** I sung in-character but, somehow, I had a hard time singing it well. (embarrassed)

**Mayushii:** Sorry! I was very worried about what everyone thought, if they really wanted to sing this line and such.

**Kaya:** You thought they weren’t any good?

**Yoppi:** Mayushii said before that the lyrics were perfect and I was very glad. Putting them all together and making everyone satisfied with the result must have been tough. You should be more proud of yourself!

**Mayushii:** Should I? Alright, then. (laughs)

\[According to Mayu, when she wrote Polaris, she imagined them singing it while enveloped in a “sea of stars”. It was a pipe dream that she never imagined would come true until they got to perform it on Animelo Summer Live 2018 and Animax Musix 2018 Yokohama. As such, she was very grateful because WUG made it happen.\]

**\--- Now, with _Shin Shou_ drawing to a close soon, is there anything you would like to say to everyone?**

**Mayushii:** I want everyone to see it through until the end. I want to more people to hear our songs, especially I-1 Club's and the one we promised to make.

**Yoppi:** The girls poured their all into heart into producing a wonderful song in the anime. I hope that everyone, even those who don’t know about us, get to enjoy it.

**Kaya:** Thank you for watching _Shin Shou_ up until now. MONACA did the music for it. I hope you keep listening to them.

**Tanaka:** We’re going to release a compilation of all the music \[Wake Up, Best! 3\], so please look forward to it.

**Hirokawa:** We've produced a lot of them so give them all a listen. And there's still some yet to be heard, so don’t miss it.

**\--- Thank you for sitting in for this interview!**
