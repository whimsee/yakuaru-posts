Famitsu released two interviews as part of their weekly 3/21 issue that was published on March 7, 2019, the day before WUG’s Final Live. It was taken on January, presumably after Final Tour Part III KADODE Osaka, Nagano for Part 2. 

It had two versions: Print and Online. The print version is part of the 18-page section dedicated to WUG but largely edited for space. The online version is unabridged—more lively and casual.

**WUG Is Family**

* * *

**\-- What's your most memorable experience as WUG?**  

**Aoyama Yoshino (Aoyama):** Me first!  

**Yoshioka Mayu (Yoshioka):** Sure, go ahead!  

**Aoyama:** My highlights are the places we flew to overseas but in Los Angeles—  

**Yoshioka:** (interjects) Los Angeles?  

**Eino Airi (Eino):** Maybe you meant Chicago (Anime Central 2014)?  

**Aoyama:** Oh, right! It was Chicago. The US really is a big country.  

**Eino:** I never expected I'd even go overseas.  

**Aoyama:** We also went to Taiwan and Shanghai since they’re quite close from Japan. I know the US has cultural aspects that I’m unaware of but there really are huge differences.  

I can still clearly remember when we went to Chicago and _Frozen_ was very popular at the time. We were heading to the elevator hall while singing _Let It Go_ in Japanese then people behind us continued the song in English.

(English) Let It Go

(Japanese) Ari No Mama De

**Eino:** That was so cool! It really surprised me.  

**Aoyama:** I didn't expect it at all. It turned into something like an improvised musical. The whole trip felt liberating and I experienced lot of things that would not have been possible in Japan so it really left an impression on me... So, who's next?  

\[This trip to Chicago for ACEN 2014 (May 14-17) was to promote the group and anime which just finished broadcasting at the time. They performed on stage and did interviews but also a few anecdotes came out of it. They remarked how Nanami was surprisingly outgoing (compared from before) and excited to practice her English which she did elective studies for, how Yoppi (Aoyama) practically begged the staff to let her into the angela concert and dragged Mayu into it, who practically had no idea who they were but joined so she could learn from them and ended up enjoying it. They also tried deep-dish pizza and only Miyu got to finish her portion and at least two more slices.\]  

**Eino**: It's a hard question to answer.  

**Okuno Kaya (Okuno):** I know...  

**Yoshioka:** For me, it was our debut at Summer Wonder Festival (WonFes) 2013. 

**Aoyama:** It was in July 7, 2013. 

**Okuno:** You still remember the date?  

**Yoshioka:** That probably was the most nervous I've ever been in my life.  

**Eino:** Me too. I don't even remember what happened once we got on stage.  

**Yoshioka:** All I remember was being startled because I was looking elsewhere since couldn’t look at the audience then I noticed smoke coming out underneath us and we weren't told about it beforehand. (laughs)  

**Eino:** I remember that!  

**Yoshioka:** That didn't happen when we rehearsed so I almost panicked.  

**Aoyama:** It also felt strange hearing the crowd do calls for us.  

**Eino:** Being on the receiving end of that was something I had to get used to. (She's expressed publicly that she's a fan of idols)  

**\-- I can imagine feeling the same way. (laughs)**  

**Okuno:** For me, it was the training camp we did before that show.  

**Eino:** Yeah... That, too.  

**Okuno:** We underwent training to focus on things each of us needed to work on and we were feeling very anxious. I didn't know what was going to happen to me, if I’m lagging behind, or if I’m actually going to do voices for an anime.  

**Eino:** I can relate.  

**Okuno:** We weren't sure if there really was going to be an anime set to air next year or if we're going to be working as voice actresses. We've mentioned this before but we eventually did learn about our characters in detail as printouts displayed on a whiteboard. That was very memorable because she was going to be the very first character I will portray and finally seeing it reassured me that it was going to happen.  

**Aoyama:** It did help. (laughs)  

**\-- So character details haven't been decided yet when you were auditioning?**  

**Okuno:** They were to an extent.  

**Yoshioka:** But they were very different from what we saw at the time.  

**Eino:** They changed a lot.  

**Aoyama:** We already knew right from the start that we would be sharing names with them and I was going to be the leader.  

**Eino:** Yeah. It was so long ago.  

**Yoshioka:** I already knew that my character has a dark history with I-1 Academy.  

**Eino:** Mine was a little vague at the time, but after our training camps I got the impression that she was the least cheerful of the girls. Looking back at it now, she does have a laid-back and carefree side to her but back then, she seemed to be the type that was pessimistic.  

Also, during our training camps we would stay at a hotel, wake up early to do running exercises before going straight to voice acting, dance, and singing lessons. One camp went on for ten days. Of course, we understood that it was for our sake, but we had no clear goal in front of us or any idea of what kind of unit we were going to be so I was feeling very uneasy.  

We were practically strangers to each other, so those grueling days of training, not knowing what it was for, why the seven of us were assembled for a group, and the crippling anxiety that came with it stays in my memory even today.  

**\-- But did those experiences deepen your relationship or at least got everyone to know about each other?**  

**Eino:** I think that was the point of those camps.  

**Yoshioka:** We also learned about each other through live broadcasts.  

**Eino:** That, too.  

**Aoyama:** I used to be very nervous doing them.  

**\-- How so?**  

**Aoyama:** We used to get very awkward in front of an audience.  

**Eino:** Yeah. We were still new to everything, after all.  

**Aoyama:** We didn't know how to express and present ourselves.  

**\-- I imagine you were also told not to do anything weird.**  

**Eino:** Right! Our manager would scold us if we did.  

**Aoyama:** We were so intimidated by the thought, we ended up being awkward on stage.  

**Eino:** We appeared so flat and robotic, we just followed what the script told us to say and do.  

**Aoyama:** It was like, “Just say this and that and nothing else.”  

**Yoshioka:**  It was very generic.  

**Aoyama:** Do you remember when we held meetings every night?  

**Eino:** We had to write down what we needed to do on a notebook.  

**Yoshioka:** We called them diaries.  

**Eino:** Yeah, they had us write them.  

**Yoshioka:** I’ve kept all of them back home.  

**Eino:** I guess you could say they hold the most memories. It wasn’t all great and fun when we started. There were a lot of painful memories as well… which were the training camps.  

**\-- That topic seems to come up at lot for all of you.**  

**Eino:** It was really tough and exhausting, both physically and mentally.  

**Okuno:** We barely had time to sleep.  

**Eino:** We had to practice dance steps once we got back to the hotel because they wanted it to be perfectly memorized the next day.  

**Aoyama:** And they were pretty hard to begin with.  

**Eino:** It was the same for our singing lessons. We had to memorize them for the next day, and we also had homework for voice acting lessons. On top of all that, we had to write everything we did that day on our diaries.  

**Aoyama:** I was so tense and scared every day.  

**Eino:** We probably felt it most during those times.  

**\-- So I assume your most painful memories as a group were those training camps?**  

**All WUG:** Yes.  

**Eino:** That’s because once we started officially doing activities, there were fans cheering us on. But no one knew about us at that point so we only have ourselves to encourage, and there were so many times when I hated myself.  

**Yoshioka:** We didn't have a concrete goal other than building our fundamentals.  

\[According to Mayu's final blog post, the first training camp was her final audition since she wasn't a proper member yet, unlike the rest. She was officially welcomed as a member on April 1, 2013, the day WUG was officially established.\]  

**Eino:** But we all wanted was to sing and become voice actresses.  

**Aoyama:** As Kaya mentioned before, being left out was the worst. I wasn't good at dancing because I used to see no point in it. I used to complain, "I’m here to become a voice actress, why do I have to take dance lessons?"  

Not only that, we were separated into two groups—Those who can and can’t dance. Those of us who can’t had to sit at the side and watch the others as we get left behind.  

**Okuno:** That actually happened! It was cruel...  

**Aoyama:** We were left to watch them with tears in our eyes.  

**Okuno:** It's one of my regrets. I asked myself, "Why didn't I learn how to dance?"  

**Aoyama:** Me too. "Why did I quit ballet?"  

\[The third member who couldn't dance was Minami, who was unable to do simple two-step dances and couldn’t sing while dancing, on top of her lack of stamina.\]  

**\-- I had no idea... I guess it’s safe to say that this topic only brings painful memories.**  

**Yoshioka:** Oh, the trauma... (laughs)  

**Eino:** I have to say, though! It's emotional to look back on it now. Six years in and we’ve gotten pretty good at both singing and dancing.  

**Aoyama:** One really can't tell what happens in the future.  

**\-- But wasn’t it tough that no one else has seen your efforts since you haven't officially debuted then?**  

**Aoyama:** If anything, we just get scolded and lectured all the time.  

**Eino:** I get why but I don't think it would hurt if we had gotten a little more encouragement.  

**Okuno:** The staff gave off a vibe expecting us to put all our effort into everything. Of course, we were doing that... But without a goal to look forward to, we kept at it feeling anxious and uneasy all throughout.  

**Yoshioka:** We held on through every setback.  

**Okuno:** I'm honestly pleased no one gave up.  

\[A few of the members have considered giving up during those camps. Nanami recalled an anecdote during their first camp where she cried and opened up to Airi, her roommate at the time, about quitting, but she held on and mentioned in 1st Live Tour's final MC that she was glad that she stayed.\]  

**Aoyama:** We mentioned those diaries before, right? Our manager at the time would go through each of them and leave messages.  

**\-- Interesting...**  

**Aoyama:** I hated dancing but I took those lessons seriously. But since I'm fairly new to it compared to the rest, I had trouble memorizing steps, and our manager at the time wrote something like, "Yoshino, why aren't you taking today's lesson seriously? You'll lag behind if you don't get it together." Reading that brought me to tears... I was doing my best but it didn't matter if it they didn't notice it.  

**Eino:** Poor you.  

**Aoyama:** Poor me.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** I think we all had moments like that. I did.  

**\-- All right. Let's leave all this training camp talk behind and move on to brighter topics! Can you tell me about moments that made you happy?**  

**Yoshioka:** I have to say it was when we started interacting more and more with people who appreciate our work. I used to hate singing and the idea of singing in front of people. I passed the audition, went through harsh training camps, but I haven't had many opportunities to sing in front of an audience. Our debut brought in people who would judge my ability.  

As it went on, people started to compliment us on our performances and my confidence grew. There wasn't any specific incident but that contributed a lot. And now I love singing so much I'm proud to list it as one of my hobbies and skills. I really hated it before because I thought I wasn't cut out for it.  

\[According to her, she used to be bad at singing and it was her mother who personally trained her because she's great singer who used to be a band vocalist since high school and "couldn't bear to have a daughter who can't sing." Karaoke sessions became harsh training sessions that often led to arguments that made her hate singing. She also had stage fright and it took continued support and praise from fans, event after event, even unrelated solo events, for her to finally get over it and enjoy both singing and being on stage.\]  

**\-- That's unexpected to hear from you.**  

**Okuno:** For me, it was our 5th Anniversary Live that we held for our fan club members. I especially remember our fans bringing candles to celebrate the group reaching its fifth year. Seeing them with candles, being genuinely happy for us... I still remember it vividly and it still makes me smile. (laughs) I think birthdays are happy occasions that are meant to be celebrated. It wasn't our birthday but it also kind of was, so I was glad to celebrate "our" birthday with everyone.  

**Eino:** It was certainly heartwarming. Mine's a little out of the ordinary—it's the letters I've gotten from fans. At this day and age, handwritten letters aren't the norm so it doesn't happen as often anymore. I've never written one myself so I've never understood how it felt, but so many of our fans put their feelings to words and send them to me, which I read. They write about anything and some even send letters every week. I'm glad I get to know how they truly feel and I'm grateful for our activities because of it.  

\[Out of everyone, Airi regularly writes in the blog about how grateful she is at getting letters from fans. She often tells them how it cheers her up as she reads and re-reads them, and that they're the reason why she works hard. Often she leaves questions in the blog for them to answer.\]  

**\-- I often hear that whenever you do events that go on for consecutive days, some fans would send you letters after just having seen it the previous day.**  

**Eino:** It really does happen and it keeps us motivated. Even if we mess up, they give us glowing compliments, telling us what we did well. It keeps our spirits up the next day and makes those events all the more worth doing.  

**Aoyama:** For me it's... hmm... not that one... (silence)  

**\-- ... I guess silence means none?**  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I have many but it's hard to pick the best one!  

**Eino:** How about going with the first thing that comes to mind?  

**Aoyama:** (silence)  

**Yoshioka:** Still nothing. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** Ahhh... Can I just say that I'm glad I met you all?  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** To be honest, I didn't like anyone much at first. But now we understand each other so well, and I never expected anyone would understand me... I was anxious of that back then.  

**Yoshioka:** What's this? A wedding speech? (laughs)  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I mean, I also had a hard time at the beginning. Each of us had different goals and motivations. Some of us wanted to become singers, some voice actresses. Some auditioned on a whim. And I was honestly shocked when I learned of those when we met for the first time. Because here I was, aspiring to become a voice actress for years, who took audition after audition yet failed all of them. It got to me.  

We were all on the same boat, directionless, scattered, worried and anxious about the future, but we didn't have the luxury to think about anyone other than ourselves. Then suddenly, I became the leader and I had to pull myself together. It felt impossible at first, but over time, we met so many people, became closer and more united until we started feeling comfortable around each other.  

WUG is like family to me. By family, I mean the kind that you don't want to be around with all the time so sometimes you want to be away from them. That actually happened.  

\[Circumstances and motivations surrounding auditioning through interviews, blog posts, and second-hand sources:  
  
Yoppi always wanted to be a voice actress, more than anyone in the group, because of her love of anime but also her strong desire of moving to Tokyo. To that end, she applied for multiple auditions, some well known like Milky Holmes’ Search for Elly and the 1st Anisong Vocal Audition. She auditioned with _Sekirei_ by Hayami Saori (Her personal idol), Inoue Marina, Hanazawa Kana, and Endo Aya.  
  
Mayu wanted to break into the entertainment industry and, like Yoppi, had tried and failed multiple auditions and saw the WUG audition as one of her last chances before she had to reconsider her choices since her confidence had sunk at that point. In her interview, her reason for auditioning was to "find herself." She auditioned with _Ready!!_ because she realized the composer (Kosaki Satoru) was in the room and she wanted to make a good impression.  
  
Minami wanted to become a voice actress since grade school, where she proclaimed in front of everyone after receiving her diploma that she'll become one someday. She then proceeded to do club activities as practice for that goal (Theater and Broadcasting) during middle school and high school until she found the WUG audition, her first audition since she wanted to prove that her goal wasn't just on a whim, and figured to give it a shot. She auditioned with _Sorairo Days_ by Shoko Nakagawa and _Tsugaru Kaikyō Fuyugeshiki_ by Ishikawa Sayuri.  
  
Nanami admired AAA (Avex) and aspired to be a vocalist (she used to be a vocalist and guitarist in a local cover band) and her mother, who had applied her to numerous auditions before, was taken in by the WUG audition. She auditioned with 虹 by AAA.  
  
Kaya took the audition as a final shot before she had to look for work and give up on becoming a voice actress, a dream she secretly carried and regretted not standing up to when she told her parents when she graduated high school. She initially applied not knowing that it was to do voices for an anime, assuming that it was strictly for "Anisong" since it was the first word in the title until she reached the second screening process. She auditioned with _Leia_ by Yuyoyuppe.  
  
Miyu applied for the 1st Anisong Vocal Audition (for i☆Ris) on a whim since she wanted to be part of the industry in some way. She reached the final screening and felt overwhelmed by the determination of the other applicants so she took the rejection as motivation to try harder for the next one (for WUG). She auditioned with _Lost My Music_ by Hirano Aya then _Starry Heavens_ by day after tomorrow for the second screening.  
  
Airi auditioned so she could be part of an anime set in Sendai, even as an extra, but as she would explain below, it's also because of her love of Sendai. She auditioned with _Seikan Hikou_ by Nakajima Megumi.\]  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** There are times when I just want to be alone.  

**Eino:** It usually happens whenever you get nervous or anxious.  

**Aoyama:** There was one that lasted for about two hours then on the train back I completely regretted how mean I was being.  

**Eino:** It was really weird. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** And very adorable. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I’m as close to them as my real family so I want to make the best of the two months we have left until our Final Live. I can't just waste these moments being petty so I want to approach each and every day with them happy and excited.  

**\-- When did you start becoming closer to each other? Was there a turning point that sparked it?**  

**Yoshioka:** It would have to be right around the time we didn't work on the anime so we did tie-ups while planning our very own live tour.  

**Eino:** I'd say the 4th Live Tour as well.  

**Yoshioka:** Exactly.  

**Eino:** It hasn't been that long ago... (smirks)  

**Yoshioka:** Until then, the anime staff organized the live tours for us. This time, we got to decide the setlist, and was even involved in picking and designing the outfits.  

\[According to blog debriefings and interviews, Mayu asked if they could decide the setlist for 4th live. She expected to be turned down but the surprisingly got approval so she and Airi decided the setlist for the whole tour. The girls also designed the TUNAGO outfit, which is a mix of styles from their previous outfits + new ideas.\]  

**Aoyama:** For me it was shortly after our event at UDX Akihabara (4th Showcase Event) coming into 2014. It was our last event of the year before WUG Solo Festa (_Wake Up, Girls! FESTA. 『イベント、やらせてください！』_) and that was the first time I was chewed out by our dance instructor. She told me that my current ability wasn't fit for a live show and hearing that broke me and I began thinking how hopeless I was at dancing. I was very self-conscious at the time especially in showcase events because I wanted to stand out and make a good impression.

\[She cited this moment at an interview as one of her turning points. She didn't give up because she told herself that she's the leader, which meant she had to keep herself together, and that resolve pushed her to study dance in earnest.\]

**Eino:** We weren't a solid team then.  

**Aoyama:** We were all absorbed in our own goals. Or rather, we had our hands full and we only focused on ourselves. That's how we were by the end of that year and we had to step it up.  

**Yoshioka:** I still have vivid memories of that event.  

**Eino:** Me too.  

**Aoyama:** I remember Minami singing _Amagi-Goe_.  

**Eino:** Right.  

**Yoshioka:** The Solo Festa was new to us since we don't usually do Talk and Live events.  

**Eino:** We did our best but we all had different ideas in mind. It was like we weren't taking each other seriously.  

**\-- But thanks to your dance instructor, I imagine it set all of you on a single direction.**  

**Eino:** It did but honestly, we weren't seeing each other as a single unit yet.  

**Aoyama:** Our dance instructor doesn't get upset at us no matter what so I really hit hard when she did. She'd always say "you did well" and "that was great" but that was first time she came into the break room looking very upset. I broke down in tears.  

**\-- You seem to recall a lot of incidents where you cry.**  

**Aoyama:** I know... It doesn't take much for me to cry.  

**Yoshioka:** Yoppi cries a lot.  

**Eino:** Yoppi and Miyu used to cry a lot in the beginning.  

**Aoyama:** Miyu cried every showcase event.  

**Eino:** It was really cute though.  

**\-- We're back to depressing stories again. (smirks)**  

**Eino:** There's more to come. (laughs) It's our story, after all.  

**\-- I guess you're right. Let's move on to another topic: Can you tell me any anecdotes you haven't told anyone until now?**  

**Yoshioka:** Our first Anisama (_Animelo Summer Live_) rehearsal comes to mind. I was terribly late.  

**Aoyama:** You were gone almost the whole day. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** We were also doing shoots inside the venue and it almost seemed like I was trying to sneak in.  

**Okuno:** Like something that could be used for an extra.  

**Yoshoka:** Right. If you rewatch it, I was the only one missing while the rest of them were briefed on what to do.  

**Eino:** I've forgotten most of it.  

**Yoshioka:** That's all I remember, being very late to our first Anisama rehearsal. The place I was staying at was so far away so getting there took forever.  

**Eino:** At least we can laugh about it now.  

**Aoyama:** Now that we're on the topic, there's another one.  

**Eino:** Oh?  

**Aoyama:** The Unagi Incident  

**Okuno:** Ah...  

**Aoyama:** It was from way back, when we were recording _Sugao de KISS ME_. I overslept and woke up right when we should have started. The studio was extremely far away from where I was so I prepared for 5 minutes before rushing to the station. But when I arrived, Hirokawa Keiichi-san (arranger), Tanaka Hidekazu-san (composer) and the rest of the staff were just sitting there eating unagi.  

**Eino:** Oh! I heard about this!  

**Aoyama:** On the way there, I was so late I thought of killing myself since there was no way I'd get through it without getting fired at least. But there they were, happily eating unagi...  

**Eino:** Weren't those the expensive kind as well?  

**Aoyama:** Yeah. They greeted me like nothing was wrong and I was so confused since I thought I was done for... so I started crying and they panicked.  

**Eino:** Did you end up having paying for it?  

**Aoyama:** I did afterward. They told me we'd start right away after they finish eating. So we prepared and finished recording soon after. If you ask Hirokawa-san and Tanaka-san what their most memorable recording experience was, they'd always mention the "Unagi Incident" until I asked them to stop. But since we're disbanding, I don't mind anymore so here it is and that should be it regarding that.  

**\-- That's a really funny anecdote. (laughs) Who's next?**  

**Eino:** Everyone should know about this already but back then, Kaya and I didn't get along well.  

**Okuno:** Yeah... I regret how it went on for a while.  

**Eino:** Our relationship started from a mutual misunderstanding and incorrect assumptions about each other so we quickly patched it up and became friends since then.  

**Aoyama:** Back then, I often listened to Aichan (Eino) open up about it.  

**Okuno:** huh? Really? (laughs)  

**Eino:** I'd go, "I can't talk to Kayatan (Okuno). What should I do?"  

**Aoyama:** Yeah, just like that.  

**Eino:** I kind of felt that Kaya was the same with me so I was at a loss at how to break the ice.  

**Okuno:** Since I was living in Iwate at the time and Aichan in Sendai, we took the same bullet train. But all we did once we boarded was sit quietly and listen to music through earphones. Then once we reach Sendai, Aichan would begin preparing and I'd take my earphones off just to say "bye bye" then I'd go right back to my music. (laughs) It really was like I was talking to myself. We didn't talk at all.  

**Eino:** Not a single word.  

**Aoyama:** What was going through you that time?  

**Okuno**: I had no idea why it happened, really.  

**Eino:** I guess both of us ended up having wrong assumptions of each other in spite of never having gotten to know each other.  

**Okuno:** Right. We were both scared to open up.  

**Eino:** But now we're the type of friends that chat until four in the morning.  

**Okuno:** (cheerful laugh)  

**Aoyama:** We used to chat until the late hours back then. Now though, I just want to go to bed once I get home.  

**Eino:** We’re getting on in years, after all.  

**\-- (laughs) Moving on, can you tell me a secret that you've kept even among each other?**  

**Aoyama:** None!  

**Eino:** A secret about a member or the whole group?  

**\-- About a member, if you don't mind divulging...**  

**Eino:** I don't think we have any secrets like that.  

**Okuno:** I wonder if there is...  

**Yoshioka:** I have one. I'm usually present for Yoppi's recording sessions and there was this incident during _Kotonoha Aoba_'s recording...  

**Aoyama:** Oh!  

**Yoshioka:** Do you remember?  

**Aoyama:** I do. I collapsed.  

**Yoshioka:** Yeah... You died. (laughs)  

**\-- Huh?! What do you mean?**  

**Yoshioka:** The kind where you had to call in an ambulance.  

**Eino:** Were you stressed out?  

**Aoyama:** Yeah. I had a breakdown.  

**Yoshioka:** I was watching over the studio on the monitor and she was crouched over, which got me worried so I alerted staff and hurried to check in on her and she had collapsed by the time we got there. We resumed recording after taking a break and what we recorded there made it to the final version.  

**Eino:** That makes me want to listen to it again. I feel jealous, actually. I wish I was there.  

**Yoshioka:** So you could see what was happening with Yoppi?  

**Eino:** It's a piece of history. I'm really jealous.  

**Okuno:** Let's see... Oh, Aichan, can I talk about "that"?  

**Eino:** (laughs). Sure, why not? (laughs) I never mentioned it since I wasn't sure there was a good place to do so.  

**Okuno:** So Aichan, Yoppi and I were in a room together...  

**Aoyama:** Oh! I remember! "That" incident.  

**Eino:** Yeah. What else could it be?  

**Okuno:** We witnessed an Aichan night terror episode. (laughs)  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** Airi went to sleep very early.  

**Eino:** Yeah. I was sleepy so I dozed off.  

**Aoyama:** Then she suddenly started thrashing while shouting at the top of her lungs. It was out of nowhere!  

**Okuno:** And she was lying face down the whole time.  

**Aoyama:** It was like she's in pain.  

**\-- That's terrifying!**  

**Okuno:** So Yoppi and I looked to each other in shock.  

**Aoyama:** We kept calling out to her, "Aichan, Aichan" but it didn't work.  

**Eino:** I didn't hear it at all. I couldn't.  

**Okuno:** It was scary.  

**Aoyama:** Horrifying.  

**Eino:** I'm completely fine but I wasn't sure whether I should write about it. Every once in a while, I get a dream about being taken by some people to some faraway place only to be brought back afterward.  

**Aoyama:** Aichan's predisposed to it.  

**\-- Have you tried having an exorcism or something like that?**  

**Eino:** My mom has that too, that's why I carry a rosary with me.  

**Okuno:** That was the first time I've ever seen it happen.  

**Aoyama:** But we haven't witnessed it since then.  

**Okuno:** Me too.  

**Aoyama:** Speaking of which, Miyu...  

**Eino:** Oh, Miyu and the cute things she says while asleep?  

**Aoyama:** She can fall asleep with her eyes open and she can even do it while sitting.  

**Yoshioka:** One time, she was at her phone playing _Toware no Palm_ and she just fell asleep. So I asked if she was still playing and she responded, "Yes. I am."  

**Aoyama:** She can sleep while sitting cross-legged or face-down. If you ask her what time she set her alarm for tomorrow, she'd say "8 o'clock" but she won't have any memory of it. It was like she's asleep the entire time.  

**Eino:** And sometimes, she just wakes up all of a sudden.  

**Aoyama:** When you tell her, "The bath is ready", she'll immediately wake up and say "Okay, I'm going." But she won't remember any of it. Don't worry, we can share this!  

**Eino:** She said it was fine.  

**Aoyama:** And that's all. We have no more secrets left to share.

**6 Years of Pushing Through Together**

* * *

**\-- Which aspect of yourself has changed since your debut?**  

**Yoshioka:** I awakened to a new and cool side of myself, and I had no idea I ever had it in me.  

**Aoyama:** I didn't expect it too.  

**Eino:** But it's all good. I know you're still adorable inside.  

**Yoshioka:** Stop! (laughs)  

**\-- (laughs)**  

**Yoshioka:** I mean it though, about that side of myself. It could have been inside me all along but I realized it thanks to them acknowledging it. Then all of a sudden, people stopped calling me cute and it felt weird. I'm so embarrassed now, wondering if I could have been able do to that during our debut.  

\[Airi, Yoppi, and Nanami mentioned in an interview, how Mayu and Kaya were the last ones to break out of their shell and establish their own identity, which happened relatively late (around 2017) compared to the rest.\]  

**Eino:** I know what you mean. I became a much more positive person. I used to be very pessimistic and I'd feel hopeless or see no point to doing things, or I question and find reasons not to do it. But now I want to give things a shot, or even if I can't do it yet, it won't discourage me from trying again. And I didn't just become optimistic, I also started gaining confidence in my own abilities and started believing in myself. I hope nobody takes it the wrong way but because of WUG, I learned to appreciate who I am.  

**\-- What brought that on?**  

**Eino:** We were so awkward to each other when we first met but eventually our individual personalities started to come out, and of course, that led to us discovering together the good traits we have. And some of us like to joke around which provided material to brighten the mood. That kind of relationship gradually made me see the things I was good at and the things I find fun. They made me realize a lot of things about myself and that improved my outlook.  

\[Airi used to mention in the blog how much of a slow-starter she is. It was only until recently when she became much more positive and forward-facing in what she does, even going so far as admitting that while her pace is slower than the others, she is determined to push forward and make something of her own. After the disband announcement, she would often mention that she will find her own "genre", her own way of doing things.\]  

**Aoyama:** I figured out my own personal style. I originally thought voice actors didn't have to wear makeup, that they only need to use their voice and thus, don't need to dress up.  

**\-- I'd call that having lot of pride in your craft.**  

**Aoyama:** Or just being pretentious. (smirks) I did have some interest in makeup but I thought if I had time for that, I should use it on something else. That thinking started to change once I entered my second year.  

**Eino: That's pretty late.**  

**Aoyama:** It really was! Whenever I took selfies I used to think, "Who cares if it isn't cute? I'm a voice actress so..." I had a bad habit of telling myself that, but that just doesn't work at this day and age. I should at least learn how to do it. Just because I can't, doesn't mean I shouldn't try. So I changed my outlook and tried least giving it a go. That applies to dancing as well. I can't just leave it to thinking that I can't do it.  

College was the turning point. Once I was there, I learned that wearing makeup was the norm for everyone and I realized that I can't be stubborn anymore. That I should give it a shot. That I shouldn't be stuck in my ways as an outsider. In that way, I grew and learned my sense of aesthetic. (cheerful laugh)  

**Okuno:** I broke out of my shell. I used to sing our songs, especially WUG's, as Kikuma Kaya, where I project a cool persona. There used to be a time where I didn't smile at our live shows because I thought I had to seem cool and composed like her so I never had any opportunity to be myself, Okuno Kaya. At the time, we needed to be just like our characters, so I worried where my place was. I started feeling my own identity disappear.  

But I thought I should feel glad because I became a voice actress, voicing a character in an anime. I should be glad of many other things as well but I also wanted people to see me for who I am. So on our 4th Live Tour, I stood on stage as myself and started having fun at our shows. Even though I was singing using character's voice, it had a piece of me in it too, which made me glad.  

\[Kaya would post in blogs how much she appreciates people trying to understand her and her quirks. She would usually post something cryptic or leave things hanging for people to wonder, who would then send her letters trying to figure them out.\]  

**\-- It worried you that much to be her?**  

**Okuno:** I convinced myself I had to project as my character no matter what.  

**Aoyama:** Yeah. We absolutely had to back then.  

**Okuno:** It's hard to know if the audience were coming to our shows because of the anime or because of us. But the anime has such a strong pull, so I would rely on my character instead. If there were fans out there who love us, it would be because we're voice actresses, so I assumed they'd be glad if we used character voices. However, in doing that, I couldn't figure out how to bring myself out and I really wanted to, which left me conflicted.  

**\-- What finally brought you out of it?**  

**Okuno:** It was our first stage play, _Aoba no Kiroku_. I was Kikuma Kaya and I felt how different I truly was from her. At first, I thought I had to completely embody her. But it was hard because I am who I am and I look completely different from her. For one thing, I don't have blonde hair so how would that even work? (laughs)  

But once I started to act, I realized that I can't be Kikuma Kaya. I didn't have to be like her. Because Kikuma Kaya is a 2D character, and I'm a person who lives in this world. It was an enlightening experience for me.  

\[The first stage play was significant in many ways for WUG. Not only did it open another avenue for them to express themselves as the group, individually, it opened many doors for some of the members when they realized they can do stage plays (which were previously done by Mayu primarily and Yoppi and Miyu dabbled while being double/triple casted in SOLID STAR PRODUCE’s stage plays). Airi and Kaya eventually branched out to do other stage plays (_GJ_, _Hanamakura_, _Stray Sheep Paradise_, _Project Tokyo Dolls_) with staff and actors from their WUG stage plays.\]  

**\-- That's good to know. Now, can you tell me a moment where you felt glad and proud for being part of WUG?**  

**Yoshioka:** It's whenever we mess around. It's so fun. It makes me feel like this is the best part of my youth. While I did have fun at school, more than anything and anywhere else, I have the most fun during the break periods we share together where we just chat or goof off.  

**Eino:** I have a lot in mind but... This might sound weird but before we get on stage at every show, we huddle and the moment we say "It's starting" always makes me the glad.  

**Aoyama:** I had no idea. It just feels like the right way to end it.  

**Eino:** That's what I feel deep inside. I'm ecstatic whenever we get on stage but I feel the moments we have together backstage is something we alone share. I know our fans work so hard so they can see us all but the times I could be myself with all of you during those breaks in-between is special.  

**Yoshioka:** That sounds like something Hayashida Airi would say.  

**\-- Right. She would definitely say that. (laughs)**  

**Eino:** Lately, I started to think that way because I completely understand how she feels. This is where I belong.  

**\-- Aichan is Aichan, after all.**  

**Eino:** (laughs)  

**Okuno:** For me, it's whenever we perform _Beyond the Bottom_.  

**Eino:** The mood takes on a different shade whenever we sing it.  

**Okuno:** Only WUG can make that happen so I feel it's a song that only we can sing.  

**Aoyama:** I'd say the same for all our songs but _Beyond the Bottom_ feels different somehow.  

**Okuno:** That's it! There's something different about it but I can't put quite place.  

**Eino:** It's like I'm lose myself when I sing it.  

**Yoshioka:** Like we’re falling into a trance.  

**Okuno:** Right! A trance. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** It's almost like we forget there's an audience watching us.  

**Okuno:** Singing that song pulls you into its own world.  

**\-- How about you, Aoyama-san?**  

**Aoyama:** It would be... hmm? Oh, it's whenever we eat together, I guess.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** Where did that come from? (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** Our individual tendencies really come out whenever we eat. Some prefer fish, others prefer beef, some don't eat rice, some prefer vegetables, that kind of stuff...  

**Eino:** Some of us even get two boxes amount of takoyaki.  

**Aoyama:** That would be me. (laughs) I find it kind of amusing. It's like everyone comes to life whenever we eat. It's like we'd die if we didn't get what we want. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** What are you even talking about it? (laughs)  

**Okuno:** How good it is to be human. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** This is starting to get off topic!  

**Aoyama:** Same goes when we went overseas, we have our own preferences... (laughs). I should probably have a more heartfelt answer about how grateful I am being with them but when the topic of food comes up, I really start seeing how different each of us are… Um, I hope you can work this into something more presentable.  

**\-- I don't think I'll be able to! (laughs)**  

**Aoyama:** It's true in Osaka, especially, because everyone's food preferences are completely different.  

**Eino:** It's great that our personalities shine through whatever the occasion.  

**Aoyama:** If someone feels like eating a lot, they would scavenge portions that others won't be eating. Even today, some of us wanted the bottom part of the tart instead of the fruits on the top and vice versa.  

**Eino:** Supply and demand. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I didn't want the fruit so I offered to trade with someone who didn't want chocolate because I wanted that instead.  

**Eino:** And that makes you glad that you're in this group?  

**Aoyama:** Yeah. It's so us.  

**Yoshioka:** We're all over the place.  

**Eino:** Indeed we are.  

**Aoyama:** But there also are times where we completely agree on what to eat, as if we're one singular unit. I enjoy watching over them as they eat and that's it from me.

**Music and Their Own Struggles**

* * *

**\-- Let's move on and talk about music. You've done quite a lot of songs as the unit, but which of those resonates with you the most? I imagine that answer could change at any given time and that's fine.**  

**Aoyama:** To me the only song that comes to mind right now is _Sugao de KISS ME_ because of the Unagi Incident, which I'd rather forget. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** _Beyond the Bottom_. The song is fantastic and, I think, timeless, and it has a lot of solo parts, each significant and powerful. Our seniors from i☆Ris would always tell us they want cover the song for \*Wugris but I always hoped that they won't because I don't want great singers performing it. (smirks)  

(\*Wugris is a collaboration event that started in 2016 for i☆Ris and Wake Up, Girls!, shortened to "Wugris". In 2019, they were joined by their mutual junior unit Run Girls, Run! turning it to “Wugrisrun”.)  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZCTFNsrpQ8

**Eino:** Your voice is perfect for it.  

**Yoshioka:** It represents who we are as a group so I want to keep it the way it is and I always hope no other group covers it.  

\[It was mentioned in other interviews and anecdotes that _Beyond the Bottom_ is the first song (_Tachiagare_ is as well but only to an extent) that they were given complete freedom to sing as themselves instead of their characters and it was specifically made to be sung by them.\]  

**Eino:** I think we all feel the same way.  

**Aoyama:** I was so happy when I did my first character song \[_Stella Drive_\]. I felt like a dream come true since it was one of my goals as a voice actress.  

**Yoshioka:** Ah, I get what you mean.  

**Aoyama:** I made me really glad. On the day we recorded, I was able to work with the sound team and ask if I can do things this way or if I could add a harmony or chorus. It kind of became a character song that was made in collaboration. I still think of it as a gift that I struggled hard to deserve getting but I found the process fun. It feels like a step toward growth and why getting to do that song felt fulfilling.  

**Eino:** For me it's the first song I choreographed, _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_. I never expected I would get to do that and I haven't done it before. A part of me always wanted to try and I'm very grateful to be offered the chance but I also had my concerns, since it came out of the blue, that I felt conflicted.  

So I rewatched videos of our previous performances and tried to determine what makes us special and which movements make each member stand out as the cutest and in the process, I rediscovered what makes us great. Now, I feel glad I got to do that because those moves highlight how cute everyone really is.  

**Yoshioka**: You often emphasize how you designed it to bring out our cute side.  

**Eino:** I do but everyone's pretty cute just the way they are as well.  

**Aoyama:** I didn't realize it back then but she's a genius to come up with those steps.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** Genius? (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I used to think that since she's been dancing for a long time, it would be second nature to do choreography. I thought that as long as you have dance experience you should at least be able to do it but I can't do it myself so I'm very impressed and very wrong with that assumption!  

\[Despite that, Yoppi was approached specifically by _Harukana Receive!_'s director to do choreography support for Episode 7's Opening Sequence\]  

**Yoshioka:** You don't have to shout like that. (laughs)  

**\-- Who are you shouting to? (laughs)**  

**Eino:** I'm terrified now... (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** Airi's amazing. I'm so sorry I didn't realize it sooner!  

**Eino:** No, it's all right. You don't have to apologize. I did consider a lot of other factors as well such as giving fans their favorite member a moment as the center. It's impressive how professional choreographers come up with these. Our unique selling point is our charm. But not just your regular cute kind so I really racked my head trying to bring that out.  

**\-- Well said. How about you, Okuno-san?**  

**Okuno:** It would have to be _Suki no Skill_.  

**Yoshioka, Eino, Aoyama:** Oh!  

**Eino, Aoyama:** Best answer!  

**Okuno:** Our first tie up song was for _Scorching Ping Pong Girls_ (Shakunetsu no Takyuumusume) and it was our first time as WUG to do a song unrelated to the anime. We did the opening song, where Minami was the center, then Yoppi for _Love Tyrant_'s (Renai Boukun) ending song... and I was so jealous of them both.  

While I was one of the centers for TUNAGO, it wasn't necessarily a song that had a center. Even when we perform together as WUG, the character I portray, Kikuma Kaya, is never the main emphasis. But finally with _Suki no Skill_, I became the main member and I was overjoyed. Even the outfits are really cute.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al5JvmVVmfg

**Eino:** They're lovely.  

**\-- How does it feel to finally become the center?**  

**Okuno:** I'm not the type who wants to be the center of attention all the time, and I often think that I'm not really necessary in this group.  

**Aoyama:** No way. That's not true...  

**Okuno:** I still feel that way even now. It makes me really sad when I think about it that's why the fact I finally became the center, a position that is special and irreplaceable, means a lot to me. Even if it's only for one song, I'm happy.  

**Eino:** It won't be WUG if any of us were missing.  

**Aoyama:** (whispers) No, it won't be WUG without Kaya...  

**\-- That's a really nice thing to say. Let me include that in the article. (laughs)**  

**Aoyama:** (laughs). Yeah, I always thought that!  

**Okuno:** A very complex dynamic comes out when we're all together. It wasn’t this way before, though.  

**Eino:** I get what you mean. We've been together all this time, there are definitely parts about us that people can compare each of us to.  

**Aoyama:** I've experienced that before, feeling left out in a group.  

**Eino:** From an outsider's perspective, it wouldn’t be WUG without Yoppi or Kaya or anyone else but we've thought that about ourselves at some point. We've all experienced it before that’s why I think no one should be left out. We all have different personalities and that's what makes us interesting.  

**\-- I think your fans feel strongly about that as well. Even if they're only a fan of one of you, they want all of you to be there together.**  

**Aoyama:** I feel like crying now.  

**Yoshioka**: I want bring out some alcohol and keep this going.  

**Eino:** (imitating drunken speech) Everyone will cry. It will never end...  

(everyone laughs and Aoyama actually begins to cry)  

**Eino:** (looks at Aoyama) Hey! (laughs) Hold it in! Hang in there, Yoppi!  

**Aoyama:** But I'm not crying...  

**Eino:** We've gotten as far as we did because it's the seven of us and our wildly different personalities. The Business Children (Aoyama Yoshino and Takagi Miyu) are extreme cases.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** But we're united deep down, that’s why we're able to do it. Here, grab some tissues.  

**Aoyama:** I just remembered a time where I thought I wasn't needed. It was Machiasobi (Vol. 13, 2014) and only five of us (Mayu, Minami, Nanami, Kaya, Miyu) went there to do a show.  

**Eino:** The two of us were with chatting through LINE.  

**Aoyama:** And we were depressed about how unimportant we feel.  

**Eino:** We did. That was so long ago.  

\[This gets referenced in blogs and interviews how Airi and Yoppi couldn't go to a few events in 2013 to early 2015 due to school and the fact that they were still staying at their respective hometowns, Sendai and Kumamoto. For those shows, Miyu replaced Yoppi's solo parts. This situation also meant they had fewer opportunities until they finished their school obligations and moved to Tokyo in 2015, where Yoppi continued through college.\]  

**Okuno:** Don't cry, Yoppi.  

**Aoyama:** I didn't know you felt that way too.  

**Eino:** We often thought about it.  

**Okuno:** I just thought about it the other day.  

**\-- Really?! It's that frequent?**  

**Okuno:** Yeah, it just crossed my mind.  

**Aoyama:** I know it's stupid to feel jealous. And Kaya, your comments always leave me confused.  

**\-- I guess it gets tough that way, too.**  

**Eino:** It's part of being in a group.  

**Yoshioka:** It's the opposite for me. Since I'm usually the center, I have to be cool-headed.  

**Aoyama:** Liar.  

**Yoshioka:** What?! (laughs) Fine, I'll talk about it! This was when _Shoujo KouKyouKyoku_ was new. Minami and Nanami is the center for that and it was the first time I felt threatened for not being one. I thought, "Oh no."  

**Okuno:** You said that too, Mayushii (Yoshioka).  

**Yoshioka:** That's what was going through my mind when they told me I didn't have to be the center.  

**Eino:** It was like you lost something important that was keeping you motivated.  

**Yoshioka:** I thought that was all I had, my identity as "The Center."  

**Eino:** I remember that. You looked so miserable.  

**Aoyama:** (looks at picture of Mayu from then) She's over there at the side.  

**Yoshioka:** I was at an absolute loss.  

**Eino:** You said something like, "I don’t know what pose I’m supposed to make!"  

**Yoshioka:** Since Minami and I competed for the position of center during auditions, I wondered if I was going to be replaced. I thought she probably was a better fit for the role.  

**Aoyama:** And back then Minami was making waves.  

**Yoshioka:** Exactly. She was looking really good at the time and working on projects outside WUG.  

**Eino:** You were probably feeling self-conscious.  

**Yoshioka:** I guess it's hard for both of us not to feel that way, especially when you learn about things like that.  

**Aoyama:** I actually feel the same way toward Mayushii.  

**\-- It's like saying you're happy to see your friends succeed while also seeing them as your rival...**  

**Eino:** That might have played a huge part, too.  

**Yoshioka:** If I wasn't the center, I honestly wouldn't know what to do with myself.  

**Eino:** That's going a bit too far. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** Just let it all out...  

**Yoshioka:** I've been having an identity crisis lately.  

**Eino:** If you put it that way, I'm probably worse off than you.  

**Yoshioka:** You always say that. (laughs)  

**Eino:** I've honestly thought about it too, if I do belong here. I thought I was forgettable since I don't stand out like the others.  

**\-- But your dancing makes a very strong impression ...**  

**Eino:** It does but not really.  

**Aoyama:** Whenever I listen to them vent, I just feel like laughing when it gets too dramatic.  

**Eino:** That’s how it goes!  

**Aoyama:**  I know all of these worries aren’t true at all but we probably weren’t thinking of it at the time. So no matter how many times we vent, it never goes well. (laughs)  

**Eino:** How about we move on the next topic! (laughs)

**Impressions About The Four New Songs**

* * *

**\-- Let's talk about your compilation album,** **_Wake Up, Best! MEMORIAL_****. What are your impressions about the new songs?**  

**Yoshioka:** Let's go over them in narrative order starting from _Umi Soshite Shutter Doori_, which was composed by Takahashi Kuniyuki.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBx73ON\_2Rc

**Aoyama:** All the new songs have a naming scheme of X no X except for this.  

**Yoshioka:** I was in tears the entire time this was being recorded. After we did the first take, I asked Kuniyuki-sensei how it was and he told me about the meaning of the lyrics and the story surrounding the new songs. Hearing that compelled me to re-do everything because I failed to impart those feelings into my singing. So we did and the recording they eventually used was the one where I was crying the the whole time from start to finish.  

**Eino:** Wow. How emotional!  

**Yoshioka:** I followed his explanation and visualized the sights and sceneries of Sendai while I sang.  

**Aoyama:** The lyrics evoke thoughts of "a neighborhood near and dear to me," which you could associate to an appreciation of your own hometown. When I thought of that "neighborhood", somehow it's not in Kumamoto but in Sendai and its pageantry of lights. And with Mayushii's insight... the lyrics truly are brilliant. It made me cry, too.  

**Yoshioka:** Takahashi-san (Kuniyuki) also did background music for the anime, which he used as a motif. It's only an instrumental piece but it's a nice clear melody that brings out vivid imagery and places from Sendai, where the anime in set.  

**Eino:** It felt like we were actually walking through the city.  

**Aoyama:** It does.  

**Eino:** The part I did, “natsumaturi no oto,” \[Roughly, “sounds of the summer festival”\] reminded me of the time we went there during Tanabata.  

**Aoyama:** The instrumentals in and of itself brought the lyrics to life. It's something that only Takahashi-san would be able to pull off.  

**Eino:** As a whole, it brought back vivid memories from when we were there to shoot music videos.  

**Yoshioka:** Singing it reminded me of the shopping district.  

**Eino:** And wearing scarves during _Kotonoha Aoba_'s shoot. The words it used felt like it's calling back to our history.  

**Aoyama:** I cried recording the final "huudo no sono kage ni namida ga hitohira" \[Roughly, “a flood of unseen tears in the neighborhood”\] So they used a previous recording because I couldn't sing anymore. If you listen closely, it sounds a little off. (laughs)  

**Eino:** It's great how, if you listen to it, you can clearly sense each and every emotion we imparted to it.  

**Aoyama:** Especially your line, "yuuge no shitaku no nioi" \[Roughly, “the smell of dinner preparations”\]  

**Eino:** Recording it was really hard. I remember getting the melody wrong all the time. I would psych myself up for the next take then Takahashi-san would point out how I got it wrong this time, then we'd go back and forth over it. The melody is very soothing so I hope it comes across the way Takahashi-san intended it for everyone.  

**Okuno:** I have nothing to add.  

**\-- (laughs) How about the next song?**  

**Aoyama:** _Kotoba no Kesshou_. It was composed by Hirokawa-sensei and it's hard to describe.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE8QvaT9tQ0

**Yoshioka:** Seeing it performed live is where it truly shines.  

**Eino:** Honestly, I didn't expect that would be the first song we'd reveal in a live show.  

**Aoyama:** It probably wouldn't be great if we leave our fans guessing all the time.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** It's something new, after all.  

**Aoyama:** How long has it been since that interview… The 3rd Live Tour?  

**Eino:** That brings me back... (laughs) Back when our tour titles had "gomen ne" attached to them.  

**Aoyama:** (laughs). Everyone really came together to develop _Kotoba no Kesshou_ into what it is as Part III of the tour went on.  

**Eino:** I think of it as everyone putting their heads together for one stage show or production.  

**\-- After the reveal in Kumamoto, I checked fan impressions in social media and read quite a lot of comments about how impressive the dance was, and how the music was something completely new. It also seemed that the performance was evolving because by Osaka, a part was added where the penlights would have to be turned off at a certain point.**  

**Yoshioka:** We haven't done a unsettling song like that before. During recording, Hirokawa-san told us that the haunting atmosphere is ideal. As it went on, we were wondering if a gloomy song devoid of emotion is what they wanted but since no one was telling us otherwise, we kept at it. Tadano (Natsumi)-san, the lyricist, was present and also told us the same thing, which made me wonder what they mean by it. (laughs)  

**Eino:** She said that we should sound cold and unemotional.  

**Yoshioka:** Like glass.  

**Aoyama:** Or an acrylic board  

**Yoshioka:** And Tadano-san lyrical style matched the tone perfectly.  

**Aoyama:** It was difficult to do since I let my emotions flow when I sing. We were instructed to keep our faces still, be like plastic, and sing as if we're something inorganic. Even the hook had to be expressed in that singular manner, without showing expression. It presented a new challenge for us.  

\[WUG songs, especially the later ones, tend to introduce something new or challenging, which they would explain in interviews. _One in a Billion_ had a different format for dividing lines. In _Shizuku no Kanmuri_ they were instructed to sing as if they're doing a very soft lullaby. _Suki no Skill_ introduced new harmonies. Yoppi's falsetto in _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_ was added because of _Stella Drive_. _7 Senses_ was conceptualized as a tie-in song as if sung by WUG, the voice acting unit. _Polaris_ was a group effort, lyrics and division of lyrics by Mayu (with comments from the girls), choreography by Airi.\]  

**Okuno:** Then they let us sing the closing lines however we want so we were able to let out our emotions and doing so made our voices more impactful.  

**Yoshioka:** Next is _Doyoubi no Flight_, composed by Tanaka-san. I thought this song was going to be more uptempo.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrK28mYnyF4

**Eino:** Me too.  

**Aoyama:** It's a very catchy song.  

**Eino:** It's like I've heard it somewhere before and it's an easy listen.  

**Yoshioka:** What I want to point out most of all to everyone is that the hook won't be where everyone usually expects it be.  

**Eino:** That's right. Everyone expects the hook to be at a certain part.  

**Aoyama:** But it doesn't have it here.  

**Yoshioka:** And that's what most appealing about it.  

**Eino:** It's pretty unusual.  

**Yoshioka:** It's easier to notice once you read into how each section was written.  

**Aoyama:** But to make it easier, the part where we quickly go from line to line is the hook.  

**Eino:** Yeah. You'll just realize it once you reach the latter part of the song.  

**Aoyama:** Say, if this hook people keep expecting is that, an intermission, then it's a part where everyone doesn't usually sing.  

**Eino:** These songs are breaking the norm. This song in particular has the hook at an unexpected place and not at the climax of the song.  

**\-- (reads the lyrics) You're right. The part leading to the chorus is the hook.**  

**Eino:** See? It's a ridiculous song.  

**Yoshioka:** I hope that's the impression we leave in everyone's minds.  

**Eino:** I think the impression people will have about it is that it's pretty strange.  

**Aoyama:** I also want to emphasize that hook because it deeply relates to my own experience flying every saturday to Tokyo.  

\[In Final Tour Part III, Nanami, Yoppi, Mayu did a reading drama Mayu wrote detailing their experience at the beginning when they used to fly to and from Tokyo every weekend where they wait at Haneda airport eating bibimbap and venting about their school troubles.\]  

**Eino:** If only we could get ourselves at the time to listen to this song.  

**\-- At that time you were flying to and from places just like your fans.**  

**Yoshioka:** We did.  

**Okuno:** During recording, Tanaka-san asked us to pour out all the concerns and feelings we've been carrying concerning our disbandment. He wanted to write a song that can bring all those emotions together, including those from the fans. The lyrics also capture that sentiment, reading as if we were being interviewed in short notice.  

**Eino:** It's very emotional.  

**Okuno:** It's like peeking deep into someone's heart.  

**Eino:** The melody may be catchy but the lyrics hit close to home, so to speak.  

**Okuno:** Like the line "shinjite ikanai to shoumei wo shinai to" \[Roughly, “I need to believe. I have to prove (myself)”\]  

**Eino:** Everything about the song cuts deep and each part of it, when taken as a whole, makes it great.  

**\-- It has a lot of things going with it.**  

**Eino:** I think this song matches our combined voices the least and why the chorus couldn't be the hook.  

**Yoshioka:** Tanaka-sensei told us how concerned he was about dividing the final lines up until we needed to record them. Now that we've listened to the final version, I kind of understand why each of us had to sing that line.  

**Aoyama:** I wasn't supposed to have a solo part.  

**Yoshioka:** Same for me. We were supposed to be paired together in your solo.  

**Eino:** Even our dance, we made sure not to seem like we're dancing together.  

**Aoyama:** Since each of us has a distinct feeling to express.  

**Eino:** Exactly.  

**Aoyama:** This is the turning point in the narrative motif of the new songs. It's a change of pace so it feels a little strange compared to the others.  

**Yoshioka:** It's surreal how both catchy and unorthodox it is.  

**Eino:** That's why I think it's perfectly balanced.  

**Aoyama:** It doesn't really end cleanly as well.  

**Eino:** It's the turning point, after all. It's leading up to the finale.  

**\-- And by finale, your final song,** **_Sayonara no Parade_****.**  

**Yoshioka:** Please give it a listen! I'm urging you!  

**Eino:** I don't want to spoil too much about it...  

**Yoshioka:** Yeah. It's a song you have to hear before we can talk about it.  

**Eino:** Words alone won't do it justice.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Nop\_WPKoo

**\-- (After getting past the the first chorus) Wow, it's amazing. huh? The finale... I can't listen anymore. (smirks)**  

(everyone laughs)  

**Aoyama:** The lyrics are very direct. It's also named after our final live "Omoide no Parade" \[Parade of Memories\] but it shouldn't give anything away.  

**Eino:** My lips are sealed.  

**Aoyama:** There are no words to describe it.  

**Eino:** I want everyone to listen to it instead.  

**Aoyama:** And see the choreography.  

**Eino:** That too.  

**Aoyama:** Our choreographer has been with us since the start so she added steps from a song we did before _Tachiagare_, _Motteke Sailor Fuku_. It has steps from our songs throughout the years that you might go, "oh, that's from _Beyond the Bottom_! That's from _Bokura no Frontier_!!"  

\[The steps for _Motteke Sailor Fuku_ were the same ones they did for their collaboration with Luce Twinkle Wink☆ in Animax Musix 2018 Yokohama.\]  

**Eino:** It's like a greatest hits collection. If you've heard at least one of our songs, please give this as listen as well.  

**Aoyama:** We'll be disbanding in March but you don't usually see a disbanding group sing lines like "sayounara wa iya da yo" \[I don't want to say goodbye\].  

**Eino:** It's also uncommon for a group to have its final song be straightforward about saying goodbye.  

**Aoyama:** It's not a song that says, "Thank you, everyone. And take care, we'll see each other again."  

**Eino:** It's something uniquely us.  

**Aoyama:** You can even call it rough around the edges and not altogether fun and uplifting, just like our history as a unit.  

**Eino:** I'm sure all of us don't want to say goodbye so I hope the feelings we imbued in this song will reach them clearly.  

**Okuno:** Hopefully we give it its due in SSA.  

**Eino:** I can't wait to sing it.  

**Okuno:** We have to master it in the tour.  

**Eino:** I can't do it. I start crying at my part.  

**\-- It seems getting this song right requires a lot of mental and emotional preparation.**  

**Eino:** Singing this with a smile is impossible.  

**Yoshioka:** I had to closely listen to it a few times until I got used to it.  

**Eino:** The album is out so I hope everyone keeps listening to it after our Final Live.  

**Aoyama:** Though it's safe to say there would be many people in SSA who will hear it there for the first time.  

**Eino:** Which is why we have to make it perfect.  

**Aoyama:** We only get to do it in Aichi and Sendai so we'll make sure to smile as we sing it.  

\[They revealed _Sayonara no Parade_ in the last show of Aichi and performed it in Sendai before SSA Final Live. They wrote afterward how they intended Aichi's show as a way to physically and mentally prepare themselves for Sendai and SSA, since they both considered them final shows, with SSA being considered by some members as their "extra stage."\]  

**Eino:** Along with everyone there.  

**Yoshioka:** That's exactly why the phrase "gokujou no egao de" \[Roughly, “with your brightest smile”\] is in the lyrics.  

**Eino:** That's also where my tears start coming.  

**Aoyama:** And why we should give our brightest smiles when we sing it.  

**\-- Well said.**  

**Eino:** I hope everyone listens to it even long after we're gone.  

**Aoyama:** To those who have yet to hear it, there's a part at the very end during the fanfare that isn't included in the lyrics card.  

**Eino, Okuno, Yoshioka:** Ah-!  

**Eino:** Why did you spoil it?!  

**Aoyama:** The album would have been out by then so it's not a spoiler!  

**Eino:** I hope by then everyone understands what it means.  

**Okuno:** Hopefully.  

**\-- It's an amazing song...**  

**Yoshioka:** That's why it shares the title of our Final Live.  

\[This is the only title of a live show that they decided themselves.\]  

**Aoyama:** It expresses what we truly feel. Actually, when we were recording, I even insisted some lyrics be divided a certain way.  

**Eino:** I heard about that. Didn't you cry?  

**Okuno:** What happened?  

**Aoyama:** I think we've had enough stories of me crying. (laughs)  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** They told me that you were crying before you left for the day.  

**Aoyama:** Someone else was supposed to sing "watashi no uta wa akanukenakute omotai" \[Roughly, “My (singing) voice is rough around the edges”\] on the second verse.  

**Okuno:** Who? Miyu?  

**Aoyama:** I asked them to let Mayushii and I sing that part but they told me they already recorded it so I approached Kosaki-san (Kosaki Satoru, composer). We ended up having to re-record but everyone was gracious enough to go with it and that's how it came it be... and I'm so glad we did...  

**Eino:** I didn't know you felt so strongly about it.  

**\-- I imagine the way the lines were being divided strongly reflects how well you know about each other.**  

**Aoyama:** I considered the history each of us shared.  

**Yoshioka:** From our very first mishap.  

**Eino:** WUG's rocky first chapter.  

**\-- I get it. I feel as though it's a little too early to say that everything you feel is contained in this song since it will take a while until everything sets in.**  

**Eino:** Regardless though, is our final song.  

**Aoyama:** I feel like I wasn't able to sing it the best I could when we recorded. When I learned what "hikari no nai dystopia" \[Pitch-black dystopia\] meant I couldn't stop myself from crying. I just couldn't sing. So we want to spend some time to reflect on it before SSA.  

**Eino:** Please listen to it as much as you can.  

**Aoyama:** We're looking forward to everyone's smiles.  

**Leaving Behind A Strong Legacy**

* * *

**\-- Let's move on to the next topic. If there's an opportunity for all seven of you to work together again, what would you do?**  

**Aoyama:** Skydiving!  

**Yoshioka:** Not a chance!  

**Aoyama:** I want to hold hands with everyone and form a circle as we fall.  

**Eino:** It's never going to happen! Do it on your own!  

**Aoyama:** Please include this in the article. Next!  

**Okuno:** Wow. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** We brought this up during our Osaka stop the other day. We want to go to each other's weddings and sing together like old times.  

**Eino:** That sounds fun. Should we also bring someone on stage to say something. What do you think?  

**Aoyama:** Someone to speak on our behalf? I was thinking if we could do slideshow presentations about WUG at our weddings, though.  

**Eino:** How would that work?  

**Yoshioka:** Do we have to do that?  

**Eino:** It sounds embarrassing.  

**Yoshioka:** It would be a way to look back at what I've done in my life.  

**Aoyama:** Those six years will disappear as if it never happened.  

(everyone laughs)  

**Okuno:** I want to do something like, "WUGchannel, we're back!"  

**All:** Good idea!  

**Aoyama:** Aren't we supposed to do a reunion episode?!  

**\-- It's already decided. (laughs)**  

**Yoshioka:** We did say, "See you next at the reunion."  

**Aoyama:** It was at our year-end party, right?  

**\-- We won't say no to that, of course.**  

**Okuno:** Let's do it.  

**Aoyama:** So before then, let's not see each other as often.  

**Eino:** That's too much!  

**Yoshioka:** It's to make the feeling of reuniting all the better.  

**\-- Who knows what's going to happen years down the line.**  

**Okuno:** Oh no! I hope we do it before I turn 30!  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** Too real! (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** It really puts things into perspective whenever the topic of Kayatan's age comes up!  

**Okuno:** Please, I can't wait that long!  

**Eino:** For me, I always wanted us to play the Game of Life.  

**Aoyama:** Oh! I'll bring a set when we get together at Nagano.  

**Okuno:** Let's make it happen.  

**\-- I guess it's safe for me to assume that this is as good as done by the time this gets published. (laughs)**  

**Eino:** No, I don't mean it that way! They released a huge version of the game way back when. It was on TV a few days ago and I want to play that with everyone.  

**Aoyama:** Then I'll buy and bring that instead.  

**Eino:** No! (laughs) Aren't we talking about things we want to do in WUGchannel?  

**\-- I'll look into getting one once we start planning the reunion. (laughs) Okay, I've been holding off on asking this but because this will come out the day before you disband... Since WUG started as a way to promote "restoration and rebuilding", what are your thoughts about it now?**  

**Yoshioka:** My feelings about the concept of rebuilding wouldn't be as strong as they are now if it weren't for this unit. I was born in 1995, when the Great Hanshin (Osaka-Kobe) Earthquake disaster occured and I grew up constantly exposed to strong sentiments related to disaster and rebuilding so I'm not unfamiliar with it. But when I became part of WUG, I also learned about similar activities being done in other places, which made me rethink what it meant to me even more than I did back then. Once you actually go to those places and see the efforts with your own eyes, you realize that everyone should be helping each other out.  

I was able to visit these places through our activities. It was an enlightening experience and I know there would have been things I never would have realized if I never went there. Even if our own activities cease, those restoration efforts will keep going, and with it, our part in that effort. Even if the unit is gone, I want to keep going to those places. I love Tohoku, plain and simple, and I want it to be a place people keep coming back to because that's what rebuilding means for me.  

**Aoyama:** I've experienced the feeling of seeing things dear to me being devastated for the first time during the Kumamoto Earthquake Disaster (2016). They've started to rebuild but all of a sudden, being from Kumamoto became more synonymous with the disaster when it used to be about horse sashimi or Kumamon.  
  
To be frank, whenever I hear that sentiment, I want to tell them that Kumamoto is not the only place that had been devastated. Before then, I always felt sorry for Tohoku but I think that's the wrong way of seeing things. There are other places that had been hit, such as Ishinomaki and Kesennuma, and I had no idea. But in going to those places, I realized that they're not places to feel sorry for. In fact, they're wonderful places. That's what I learned over the course of our activities and that's why I think that the first part of rebuilding to realize that then go and see those unforgettable sights for yourself.  

**\-- How about the pair from Tohoku?**  

**Okuno:** I think it's fateful, in both good and bad ways, that we were able to do these activities... but I can't say I'm completely happy when I think about why we were formed. WUG came to be because of the earthquake and I don't know what to make of it because this is how I achieved my dream.  

Back when we started, I approached the staff about it. I was in tears. I asked why I was still alive when so many people died. It bothered me a lot. I hated it. I despised myself for thinking that I'm in this unit to achieve my dream of becoming a voice actress. But I realized that people can also do what they can to help while also aspiring to achieve.  
  
So our activities proceeded in earnest, and while I knew we were doing it the sake of the people of Tohoku, I had my own doubts if what we've been doing actually meant anything to anyone. It was at our first AEON Charity event when I finally felt that sense of fulfillment. It's not a huge accomplishment by any means but I felt glad that we did it.  
  
Before then, I felt like our activities were hypocritical in some way. But it's more hypocritical not to do anything at all, I came to realize. This was my chance to do something and I can't deny how much fun I've had doing them. I do honestly believe restoration efforts will be harder now that WUG is ending. That's why I'll do what I can as someone who used to do it as WUG, while finding other ways to help. That way, I'll find meaning to why I didn't die that day and why I became part of WUG.  

**Yoshioka:** It really made us think, since people from various walks of life have told us the same thing during those events.  

**\-- It would be understandable for all of you to face that kind of dilemma.**  

**Eino:** Actually, I was in Sendai when it happened and I still have vivid memories of that day. I felt sad and pained but most of all, I felt how powerless I was to do anything. We evacuated and stayed at hospitals and refugee centers, but with no electricity, I spent so much time lamenting over how I couldn't do anything to help.  
  
Then I learned about an audition for a project meant to revitalize the region. I love anime but I also thought if I could use this opportunity to do my part to help Sendai and Tohoku, however little it may be, that would be my chance to do it. So I auditioned. I was able to make that a reality when I became a member of WUG but of course, it was a long way before we could do anything at the start. But with our efforts and the help of the people of Sendai, we were finally able to do a charity event, and do all sorts of activities to revitalize Tohoku, and finally, I started feeling that I didn't pass the audition in vain.  

That said, this issue is far from being resolved. There are still places that haven't recovered and people who need help but with no one to help them. We from Tohoku are well aware there are still people suffering in the midst of all the blessings. That's why we have to stay focused, keep moving forward, and hope for a quick recovery. The fact that we're disbanding doesn't mean we'll stop helping. My resolve hasn’t changed at all so after this, I intend to continue that effort and help out in whatever way I can.  

**\-- Thank you for your passionate answers. If you imagine that today is the day before your Final Live, I want to ask what you would be feeling at that moment?**  

**Eino:** What would I feel... I can't even imagine that it's actually happening.  

**Yoshioka:** I'd probably wouldn't be able to sleep!  

**Eino:** You'll end up sleepy!  

**Aoyama:** We'll be the ones opening the show and the ones closing it!  

**Eino:** You're absolutely right!  

**Aoyama:** But we haven't done anything like that before.  

**Eino:** It probably won't sink in for me even then. We will be disbanding that day so of course I'd feel sad, but we also dreamed of performing there, like a sacred ground, so I wouldn't help but feel ecstatic.  

**Yoshioka:** I'd ask "Is this actually happening?"  

**Eino:** I don't feel it at all! But it's right there on my schedule.  

**\-- Indeed it does. Tickets are still on sale as we speak.**  

**Eino:** How should I spend the day before the show... It kind of feels like being asked what you'd do on the last day of your life. People often ask that question—if you were to die the next day, what would you do? What would you eat? It's on that level.  

**\-- What would you eat to welcome the fateful day?**  

**Yoshioka:** Exactly! What should I eat and I have to think of it now!  

**Aoyama:** That would be our last day as WUG, right?  

**Eino:** Now that I think about it, March 7 is going to be a very important day if it's the last day of this part of our lives.  

**Aoyama:** But right now it's so far away, we don't feel it at all yet.  

**Yoshioka:** I don't know. We can't even face it the way we are right now.  

**Aoyama:** Maybe there's actually no word to describe it.  

**Eino:** I can't even visualize how it would be in front of everyone.  

**Aoyama:** We've been on that stage before in Anisama but now it's our fans filling the arena? Can that actually happen? Is it really true? It's so unexpected, I can't believe it.  

**Eino:** Right. We’re excited but we also want to end without any regrets. We don't have time for that anymore and there's no going back once it's past. So let's make the best out of it, have fun, and make memories that will leave a mark in history. Isn't that why we learn from textbooks? I want that day to leave a mark in history so that people remember that such an awesome group existed.  

**Aoyama:** Something legendary.  

**\-- The birth of a legend, so to speak.**  

**Eino:** I'm not saying it lightly. It's what our 6 years of history amounts to. My feelings about WUG, including my heartfelt affection to it, will never change. So I want it to have a place in history.  

**Okuno:** I think the first thing we should do is to end without any regrets. No more mistakes. (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**Eino:** That is important as well. (laughs) The songs we sing that day will be our last after all.  

**Aoyama:** I agree.  

**Okuno:** It will cap off everything we've done up to that point and will serve as a starting line for our next step, so we'll give it its due and shine on that stage as brightly as we can. We've overcome a lot to get there. We might end up crying but I want to see lots of smiles from everyone... ah, now I feel like crying. (laughs) I can't wait to see all of them. (sniffle)  

**Yoshioka:** (To manager) We have another one. (laughs) So many people are crying. Everyone's crying!

**Aoyama:** I'm not... (sniffle)  

(everyone laughs)  

**Eino:** I tried so hard to keep it in all this time. (laughs while crying)  

**Okuno:** I've said all I wanted to say! (sniffle)  

**\-- I understand where you're coming from. It's such a large venue and it will be full of people who've been with you all this time and you want to see them all.**  

**Okuno:** I want to see it filled end to end!  

\[The maximum capacity for the Final Live was ~13,000 and it was sold out full of fans, friends, family, colleagues, seniors, juniors, and people from the industry. There was no true count of flower stands but it was ~230 individual stands (not counting the ones backstage) from personal anecdotes.\]  

**Aoyama:** I'm having so much fun, I can't even believe we're going to disband. I've said before that there are times when I don't want to be with the girls. I feel that way now. I can finally do things on my own but... (sob, sniffle)  

**Eino:** Now I'm crying like a baby. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** But I don't want to have any regrets. I want to live life to the fullest. It may be because this is the end, but I want impress everyone there and show WUG at the best it's ever been, not that one that's crying.  

**Eino:** You're right.  

**Okuno:** Yes.  

**Aoyama:** We'll be in great condition, our makeup flawless, and our spiels delivered perfectly. We'll show everyone how brightly we shine at our very best, that we can allow ourselves to cry once it's well and truly over. But not before. I want to keep living... (sniffle) as sincere, straightforward and as hard as I can. So please come and see us off. (sniffle)  

**Eino:** (sarcastic) Well said. (laughs)  

**Yoshioka:** But you put it perfectly.  

**Eino:** Let's make it hard to forget about us.  

**Yoshioka:** We'll show everyone who we are at our best that anyone would wonder why we had to be disbanded. At the very least, we'll leave behind a legacy that such a powerful group actually existed.  

**Aoyama:** Yeah and let's make a big splash once we finally get together again in WUGchannel.  

**Eino:** And play the Game of Life? (laughs)  

(everyone laughs)  

**\-- (laughs) If you look back at all your activities since the very beginning, how would you describe WUG as a unit?**  

**Aoyama:** In only a few words?  

**\-- Let's do it that way.**  

**Aoyama:** ... It's my favorite unit that I love to hate.  

**\-- Can I ask why?**  

**Aoyama:** But you said I have to describe it in a few words... (laughs)  

**Eino:** You said something curious. (laughs)  

**Aoyama:** I just mean that, nowadays, no one really knows what it feels to truly hate something. It's like people will keep their distance once they sense conflict and we're at an age where we're connected to more people than ever before. For me to find a group of girls who I can hate but share all sorts of experiences with... (sniffle) I love them so much!  

**Yoshioka:** You're crying again. (laughs)  

**\-- That’s a nice insight. Thank you. How about you, Yoshioka-san?**  

**Yoshioka:** For better or worse, WUG taught me about my limits.  

**\-- Oh... Can I ask about that too?**  

**Yoshioka:** (laughs) I'm only 23 but my six years in WUG had been very busy and fruitful and it had brought me down to the lowest depths of despair up to the highest peaks of joy.  

**\-- All right. I know it's not ideal but I guess this leaves the two of you to close this out.**  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**Aoyama:** Somehow, the ones who usually end these things managed to finish first. (laughs)  

**Eino:** Rainbow!  

**Yoshioka:** May I ask what you mean by that? (laughs)  

_(everyone laughs)_  

**Eino:** I've long thought about how we all radiate a different color. Not color in the literal and physical sense but one that comes from within, as people. I don't think there has ever been a group made up of such diverse members like us. And yet, we leave ourselves open to everyone and we're a unit that allows all of our facets to shine. That's what makes us interesting and I'm always grateful I get to be with them.  

That's what "rainbow" means—no one color overpowers another yet they shine brilliantly as one entity that anyone who sees it will be awed. I believe that word perfectly describes WUG.  

**Okuno:** I believe fate brought this unit together. Fate could be any number of things, good and bad, but who could have predicted the seven of us would find each other. We all come from different places, too. If things were normal, perhaps we wouldn't have met each other. But we did, got to do so many things, went through all sorts of experiences—fun, happy, sad, and painful.  

It's because of those experiences we can sing our songs the way we do. And our new songs—_Umi Soshite Shutter Doori, Kotoba no Kesshou, Doyoubi no Flight, Sayonara no Parade_—these songs exist because of us and us alone. I've yet to know if our fated encounter was meant to be or not but I want to believe that it is!  

**\-- It has to be the seven of you no matter what, right?**  

**Okuno:** Of course!  

**Eino:** We'll carve a moment in history on March 8 so I hope a lot of people will see it!  

**\-- Thank you for joining me for this interview! Have fun in your Final Live!**  

**Yoshioka, Eino, Aoyama, Okuno:** Thank you for everything!
