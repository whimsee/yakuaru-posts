**Changes since WUG debut**

* * *

**\-- What was your first impression on _7 Senses_****?**  

Aoyama Yoshino (Yoppi): It reminded me of _7 Girls War_.  

Yamashita Nanami (Nanamin): Yeah. I could feel how _7 Senses_ is connected to _7 Girls War_ even though so much time has passed since then.  

Eino Airi (Aichan): Some parts feel familiar and some parts show how much we've evolved. I think it captures the essence of who we are. Like our in counterparts in _Shin Shou_, it showcases our individual talents even though we are a group. And if you combine it all, you end up with something bigger.  

Yoppi: I agree. We've been going along with the flow before but now we get to show what we can really do.  

![](/images/002.jpg)

**\-- So it's like "7 Senses" actually means "7 Personalities". Since when did everyone start letting their individual personalities come through?**  

Nanamin: I think everyone went through some sudden changes.  

Aichan: We became friends when we got together for our initial lessons, but it took a while for all of us to get used to each other's tendencies as a whole.  

Yoppi: There had been times where I decided to change myself but I think a big factor was the change in environment. When we debuted, all we did was WUG-related activities and some of us were still living outside Tokyo and would only go to Tokyo for WUG. So you could say that our working environment, as well as our personal circumstances, changed our outlook.  

**\-- The group will be 5 years old next year. Who do you think has changed the most since it started?**  

Yoppi: It has to be Mayushii, right?  

Aichan: Yeah. I think it took her so long to break out of her shell because of her role as the center, since it just happened recently. She always wants to look cool but she's can be very feminine too.  

Nanamin: She's quite earnest.  

\[During the early blog days, Mayu would always ask Airi to rate the outfit she wore that day because of her notoriously infamous fashion sense.  It also took her some time to open up to the other members at first because she felt she was too different and everyone else got together well. It was Nanami who she first opened up to because they both speak the Kansai dialect.\]  

**\-- How about the other members like Tanaka Minami?**  

Nanamin: She's always been strong and positive ever since the start. She seemed too perfect, I thought she was a robot. (laughs)  

Aichan: She's so cool headed, but she's always there to mess around and cry with us.  

Yoppi: I thought she was scary when we started out. She carries herself so well and sees things from a broader perspective. (laughs)  

Aichan: But every once in a while she would act more like her age and it's very adorable!  

Yoppi: I think she's different from how fans see her. She's someone who I would call dignified.  

\[Other interviews would also remark how perfect she was, both for the work and the role. She was also being considered as the center along with Mayu. During 2014's activities, she and Miyu would substitute solo parts for Tachiagare and 7GW or when Yoppi is missing due to her still residing in Kumamoto at the time\]

**\-- That's unexpected. How about Okuno Kaya?**  

Yoppi: She's also just broken out of her shell.  

Airi: But only just. There’s a lot of facets to her and there's still so many things we don't know about her. I thought she was delicate at first, but she has a forward and aggressive side to her as well.  

Yoppi: We can tease her more now.  

Nanamin: When we were feeling each other out during our first get-together, she was unreadable. We were afraid of upsetting her but we’ve gotten to understand her better since.

\[Kaya can be considered one of the more unusual members of the unit but she is very open about that part of herself. She would often write in the blog about her dreams, hobbies, random thoughts, opinions, and anecdotes, often leaving them vague and open-ended, which fans would try to decipher and check in with her if they got it right. She would then write that she appreciates that people are trying their hardest to understand her way of thinking, and she always looks forward to getting a chance to express herself so that people can understand her more.

**\-- How about Takagi Miyu?**  

Yoppi: Miyu is a go-getter who can do everything well on her own. She's very motivated to throw herself into trying everything, even things she’s not good that... Or at least that’s what I think. (laughs)  

Nanamin: She's become capable of so many things now.  

Aichan: And she’s still just as earnest as ever. She can be a crybaby, but she's always a ray of sunshine.  

\[Miyu is one of the more serious ones and was remarked in older interviews as the easiest to work with because of her willingness to do anything, and learns quick without any issue. Because of that, they chose her to do _Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Chaos Okamoto Miyu ver.._ It was done in short notice but she did well during their first session.  
  
She also learned how to play the guitar, drums and DJing for her solo events. She recently had a solo debut as a DJ in MOGRA for one of her anniversary events. She also dabbled with coding using Unity and tried to make a simple FPS game.\]  

\[Regarding crybaby, she got that reputation in 2014 during their initial press tour. She messed up trying to explain what WUG is and cried backstage.\]

![](/images/003.jpg)

**\-- Now, let's talk about the three of you.**  

Yoppi: Nanami was quite awkward before.  

Nanamin: You think so?  

Aichan: You seemed like an ordinary high schooler fresh from Tokushima, but you've really grown up.  

Nanamin: I was born and raised in Tokushima, after all. (laughs). I always tried not to think too deeply, and to always take a positive outlook toward everything.  

Yoppi: You’re a shining example of your hometown.  

Aichan: And the warmth it radiates.  

Yoppi: That was a nice follow-up. (laughs)  

Aichan: But I’m really glad that you stayed with us. You have so much charm and your smile is entrancing.  

\[Nanami once thought of quitting WUG during the first training camp.\]  

Yoppi: Aichan's gotten more cheerful  

Nanamin: True. She more talkative now, too.  

**\-- How so?**  

Yoppi: If you line up all the members, she's always at the very back, like she doesn't want to be noticed.  

Aichan: It was hard when all 7 of us get together back then. If we were classmates, we could talk just about anything without a care, but it was difficult finding a good time to get a word in. But now that we know each other well and gotten much closer, I have an idea now how to approach someone or when to jump into a conversation.  

Nanamin: Airi's very reliable when we go out to support the Rakuten Eagles during their games. Her excitement is infectious.  

**\-- Eino-san does have that reputation of being a baseball fan.**  

Yoppi: She has a knack for presentation. Not just with baseball but with anime too, she's really good at making things simple to understand for anyone. If I were to rank who has the best quirk in the group, hers would be Number 1! \[Reference to WUG Radio’s “Number 1 at everything” segment\]  

\[Only Airi and Kaya (lapsed fan when all her favorite athletes retired) were knowledgeable about baseball and the other members would praise Airi, probably thanks her time as vice president at her student council, because she's good at explaining the rules and making it understandable. During Rakuten Nighters, they would hope they end up sitting next to her.\]  

Nanamin: Congratulations!  

Aichan: Thank you. I humbly accept it!  

Yoppi: How about me next!  

![](/images/004.jpg)

Aichan: You were a very different person from when I first met you. You were so stuck up.  

Yoppi: What's that supposed to mean?  

Nanamin: She's gotten herself together now.  

Yoppi: Hey! Everyone was like that back then!  

Aichan: Haha. I mean to say you've loosened up. You were so tense, like you always have something on your mind.

Yoppi: Ah. That's because I was rooming with Kaya at the time, so I thought, as someone younger, I should let her take the bath first, but then she told me I should go ahead and I was so bothered I couldn’t get over it.  

**\-- How sports club-minded (laughs). Did that kind of seniority system come from your days in the chorus club?**  

Yoppi: Yeah. It's been drilled into me so much, I didn't expect anyone to say no. I was used to cleaning the bathtub, and replacing the towels after everyone was done.  

**\-- Then the next one who uses the bath will be in for a surprise.**  

Yoppi: It's not that big of a mess to clean. (laughs) But yeah, those kinds of etiquette rules played on my mind at the time.  

Aichan: And now, you have loosened up.  

Yoppi: I think it's because I’ve come to rely on everyone. Nanami is a kind person who leaves me be, while Airi is the type of person who tries to help out if she can.  

**\-- Since when have all you you gotten this close?**  

Yoppi: Quite recently, actually.  

Aichan: We started getting comfortable with each other around the start of our third year as a group  

Nanamin: We were really bad at MC-ing at first. Nobody wanted to speak.  

Yoppi: We didn't even have a spiel.  

Nanamin: But now we've grown so much that we communicate so well on stage now.  

Yoppi: Right. But we still have much to learn. I know we can always do better.  

\[Miyu mentioned in another interview that, around the time of the 2nd Tour, she proposed planning out their MC segments, who speaks and about what, which smoothened out their MC issues.\]

**WUG-like way of presenting things usually hidden**

**\-- Going back to _7 Senses_****, can you tell me an anecdote during recording?**  

Aichan: This time we didn't sing as our anime characters. Instead we sang as the voice acting unit, "Wake up, Girls!", so singing this as a theme song for our own anime was new for us.  

\[This sentiment more or less started from _Beyond the Bottom_, where they were first told that they can sing it using their own voices and continued with _Bokura no Frontier_ where they were anxious if people actually cared about WUG as a voice acting unit separate from the anime.\]  

Yoppi: We were told to think of it as if we were making a tie-up song for the anime.  

Nanamin: If you read my line, "Doa wo isshun shimete senaka muketemo” \[Lit: Even if you look back once the door has closed (Int: To reminisce once the opportunity has passed)\], out-of-context, it sounds negative. It’s an uplifting song but lines like that are in there. So singing and getting the tone just right took some trial and error.  

[\[What makes a WUG Song?\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Wake%20Up,%20Girls!%20Shin%20Shou%20animate%20Interview%20Series%20No.%2010%20(12-26-2017))  

**\-- What's your favorite line?**  

Aichan: For me, it's "Homeraretenobiteku ochikondehaiagaru” \[I improve when I'm praised, I get up when I'm down\]. You don't usually see  “Haiagaru” \[Lit: To creep up; to crawl up (Int: Struggling from the bottom)\] in an idol song. It's also something you don't see portrayed in an idol anime, so putting attention to it is very WUG-like. In _Shin Shou_, the girls will be doing various activities with smiles on their faces, unlike the previous season where they had to bear with every setback and frustration.  

Nanamin: For me it's "Daietoshinakucha" \[Interpretation: I have to go on a diet\]. It's a catchy phrase that gets the point across. It's great because it applies to women and idols. There's even an arc related to Kaya where worries about her diet.  

Yoppi: I like the part where we all shout "Seven Senses Wake up Go!". The tempo ramps up so much that even during recording it was hard to pick out what we said. We practiced so much for it so that's the part stuck out to me the most. It means that it's time for our individual traits to go forth!

Whew, that’s profound coming from me. (laughs) We jump on the word “Go!” and I hope the audience will join in. Also, being a line that we can sing freely, we get to let all our emotions out.  

**\-- The MV showcases each member's individual talents. Airi’s a weather girl and it seems to have been shot front of Sendai Station.**  

Aichan: Right. That day, a typhoon was approaching so it was actually raining. Unfortunately, especially for Yoppi, it was also the same on everyone else’s shoot.  

Yoppi: It really was unfortunate.  

Aichan: It's a good for me, though. It made slipping into the role so much more enjoyable. I was like I was a real weather girl with a mic, holding an umbrella under the rain.  

Nanamin: You certainly looked like you were having fun.  

Aichan: It wasn't being recorded but I was actually asked to prepare a script. I basically just said something along the lines of "It's raining!", but no one actually gets to hear it. (laughs)  

**\--And for Aoyama-san, she gets to be a front page model.**  

Yoppi: I’m not a model like Yoshino-chan so that walking scene was tough. In fact, there's a scene just like this at our stage play \[_Aoba no Kiroku_\] and I could barely pull it off there, but at least I get to laugh. This time I had to be serious just like my character and we shot so much footage that my shoes were soaked by the end. (laughs)  

\[According to an interview that came out during _7 Senses_’ release, during Yoppi’s shoot, Mayu was behind the camera directing her poses because the group considers her the most expressive out of all of them and an expert at doing poses.\]  

![](/images/006.jpg)

Nanami: You looked gorgeous, though.  

Yoppi: I had to walk a certain way where you had to cross your legs and it was difficult trying to walk straight. It made me dizzy.  

**\--But I think it was worth it. The scene was perfect.**  

Yoppi: I knew I could do it if I put my mind into it!  

**\-- As for Yamashita-san, you were dancing with a costumed tiger for a kid's show called “Together with Nanamin”.**  

Nanamin: I was asked to think of my own dance moves, so I thought of actions that imitated how kids and tigers move. But Tora-chan kept forgetting them. (laughs)  

Yoppi: Tora-chan!  

Aichan: It's a tiger, after all. (laughs)  

![](/images/007.jpg)

Nanamin: It took about 5 takes, and Tora-chan rehearsed all the steps before every take.  

Yoppi: The scene was great. I imagined that it’s a show at broadcasted at 6 in the morning, then it would go over to Airi’s weather forecast. Ah! By the way, some people thought it was me in that costume. (laughs) I saw the nico stream and there were comments saying that. Well, let me set the record straight, it’s not me in that costume!  

**\-- Let’s talk about the ending theme _Shizuku no Kanmuri_****.**  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U70vOTC\_\_gA

Yoppi: I'm fond of string instruments so I was happy to learn that they were going to use them for this. It has an earnest feel to its melody. MONACA’s legendary composer Okabe Keiichi \[Who also did the Nier soundtrack\] made the song. He also did Season 1's ending theme, _Kotonoha Aoba_.  

Aichan: I think it's a great and uplifting song. The melody sounds mellow and melancholic, but once you add lyrics to it, it becomes something that inspires courage and strength.  

Nanamin: At first, I didn't get what the word “Shizuku” \[Drop (of liquid)\] in the title meant. Maybe it symbolizes what the girls are going through in _Shin Shou_, because the words like water, tears, rain, and sea came to me as I imagined it.  

Yoppi: Yeah. The girls will go through many hardships and setbacks, but the message of _Shin Shou_ is having a positive outlook and facing things with a smile in spite of it. The second verse is implying that getting to that point will not be easy. The girls will have to overcome many hardships and in doing so, the "Next chapter" will truly begin.  

Aichan: You can take _7 Senses_ and _Shizuku no Kanmuri_ together, and think of them as a summarization of our efforts, both as the idol unit and our anime personas. Like Yoppi said, feelings of hardship and worry are written in _Shizuku no Kanmuri_, while _7 Senses_ incorporates feelings of happiness and positivity.  

**\-- How did the recording sessions go?**  

![](/images/008.jpg)

Nanamin: We were instructed to sing as soft as we could.  

Yoppi: Just like how you would read a picture book to a child. It was difficult for me because that's not how I normally sing. I had trouble trying to adjust my voice to become soft, especially in the falsetto portions. Normally, I'd be comfortable because that's my specialty but those were the hardest to do. If I sing too softly, nothing would come out. They said I was getting better at it now that we're singing it more live but it's still a work in progress.  

**\-- Since the entire MV was shot in one take, making sure that everything was done perfectly had to be difficult.**  

Aichan: The MV looked so peaceful and serene but we were actually nervously shuffling around the whole time. (laughs)  

Nanamin: If anyone made a mistake we had to re-do everything!  

Yoppi: We all had spots to move to with spotlights directly pointed at our faces. If we missed them as the camera passed, it's over.  

Aichan: It was also shot in open air and it was so windy.  

Nanamin: And cold. Our outfitter prepared cardigans for us.  

Yoppi: It was really cold.  

**\-- What a tough shoot... Sounds like everyone was feeling anxious for any mistake.**  

Nanamin: We actually had to do some patchwork things behind the scenes. It wasn't anyone's fault but there was a take where the wind ruffled my cardigan and we had to redo. (laughs) So for the next take, I taped my cardigan on the inside so it wouldn’t move.

**A sports meet with i☆Ris and Run Girls, Run!?**

* * *

![](/images/010.jpg)

**\-- It was just announced that** **_Wake Up, Girls! Festa 2017 Trinity_** **will be on the 10th of December.**  

Yoppi: Everyone pitched in to make it an exciting event for everyone. We’ll make their emotions explode.  

Aichan: Every year we would say that this is a chance for us to show everyone how much we've grown. However, this being our fourth, and to celebrate _Shin Shou_, we want to do a performance that's even better than our anime counterparts can do, especially that I-1 Club and Next Storm is part of the lineup.  

Yoppi: … And all I could say was making emotions explode. Uhhmmm... We’re gonna make them shout “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!”  

**\-- That does sound like an explosion...**  

Yoppi: Yup! Let's go over to Nanami for the serious words, then.  

Nanamin: I want it to resonate with what the girls will do in the last episode of _Shin Shou_.  

**\--And how about you, Yoshino-san?**  

Yoppi: W-We'll do our very best! (laughs)  

**\--Yoshino-san...?**  

Yoppi: I’m really at a loss on what to say. Since this will be the fourth time, we'll show everyone where we’ve improved and show our long-time fans how far we've come. But I might jinx it if I say it that way.  

![](/images/011.jpg)

**\-- What are your thoughts on this year as it comes to a close?**  

Aichan: This was the year, out of all years, where I did a lot of personal contemplation about my strengths and merits. This came about because of the stage play \[_Aoba no Kiroku_ in January\]. I was new to it so I thought I wouldn't be able to act using both my voice and my body. We don’t even have the same hair. But I dug deep and overcame it, and eventually found theater fun, so much that I want to do more of it.  

\[Airi, who technically had the most lines next to Mayu in _Aoba no Kiroku_, eventually did star in a stage production (2018 in _GJ_ and _Stray Sheep Paradise_), as did Kaya (2018 in _Hanamakura_ and _Stray Sheep Paradise_, 2019 in _Project Tokyo Dolls_) as leads\]  

\[Airi often expressed in the blog how "behind" she felt with the others. During the early years, she had the most problems with acting (though they all did), that she especially had to stay overtime to re-record lines. Director Yamamoto even remarked her acting to be as “as bad” as Hanazawa Kana’s early acting roles. Later on, she overcame it and started to say something along the lines of, "I know I'm a little slow-paced, but I'm going to do my best, the way I can, so I hope people keep supporting me!"\]  

**\-- And were you able to realize new opportunities for yourself, then?**  

Aichan: Yes. I wrote down all my thoughts enough to fill a notebook and I'll try my best to realize them next year. I feel 2018 will be a turning point for us. I want more people to know about us. We're still relatively unknown in that people know about our group but not much about us personally, so I want more people to remember our names.  

Yoppi: So many things happened for me this year... which also meant there are so many things for me to reflect on. I’m not a confident person and there have been times where I tried and failed at things I wanted to do. I realized that the world isn’t as straightforward as I thought it would be. There used to be things I’d rather not do for no good reason, but I have decided to cast that aside and open myself to new opportunities.  

**\-- Can you give an example of things you’d rather not do?**  

Yoppi: I'm not good with people and I'm especially afraid of introducing myself to them. I always get paranoid that they won't like me then I’d feel bad about myself. But lately, I've been turning that outlook around, decided to stop overthinking and start changing myself. So my goal next year is to expand my perspective. I want to understand my limits and regain that confidence in believing that nothing is impossible. I'll stop myself from feeling discouraged and get myself out there!

Nanamin: I think this was the year where I faced so many challenges. In January, it was the stage play. March, the solo event. The Tour and Anisama for summer. I also performed in other shows that weren't WUG-related, and recorded for upcoming projects. Whenever I get time for myself, I relax by going home and eating things my mom sent me, which is enough to get me back on my feet. I feel 2018 is going to be like that again and more, as I aim to try many more things.  

**\--Right now, what to you want to try out most?**  

Nanamin: I want to be better at playing the flute. I showcased it before at my solo event, but I think I could do better. During the event, I played with Kitayama Asami and Lisa and they suggested if I could attend lessons to polish my technique. I think maybe I can relate the experience to my acting skills than just getting better at my hobby.  

\[This sentiment is related to when she first started taking acting lessons. Initially, she just wanted to audition so she could sing and perform, not necessarily become a voice actress. So she found acting lessons to be pointless and actively hated doing them. Until one time where their instructor gave her a heart-to-heart that learning how to act, specifically learning how to project emotions, contributes a great deal to singing. It gave her a change in perspective, which eventually lead her to enjoy acting.\]  

![](/images/012.jpg)

**\-- Finally, with WUG approaching the end of its 5th year, is there anything you would like to do as a group?**  

Yoppi: I want to go bungee jumping!  

Aichan: Nope! Count me out!  

Nanamin: It's only one person at a time, you know!  

Yoppi: Really? I would have wanted all of us to jump together. Hmm... How about skydiving? We can hold hands and form a ring while we fall. I’m sure it’s safe.  

Aichan: I think only you would want to go skydiving.  

Yoppi: I'm sure Miyu will join.  

Aichan: Two, then.  

Nanamin: Have fun!  

Yoppi: Come on...  

**\-- Looks like a no, then.**  

Aichan: If you think about it though, I think we've done well for ourselves. We've been given opportunities to do things that other groups, even voice acting units, couldn't do.  

Yoppi: (whisper) Except skydiving.  

Aichan: Cut it out. I want something more interesting, like _WUG BAN_. We got to learn so many things about each other in the process. Oh, why don't we hold a sports meet with i☆Ris and Run Girls, Run！  

Nanamin: Let's do that!  

\[They did end up holding one for _i☆Ris WUG Valentine Live 2018_ where Airi won at badminton.\]  

Yoppi: That sounds nice. Let's split it into teams of 8. And let’s add skydiving to it, too.  

Aichan: We're not doing that ever!
