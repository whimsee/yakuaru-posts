**Wake Up, Girls! Is Our HOME**

* * *

**\-- With the upcoming _Wake Up, Girls! FINAL LIVE ~Parade of Memories~_, can you give your thoughts about your final tour, HOME.**  

**Eino Airi (Eino):** Since Part I of the tour kicked off not long after the announcement of our disbandment, it largely became a time of sadness and sympathy. It was only right after, during Part II and III, that we’ve gotten past that and was able to properly tell everyone to make the best of the time left we have together. We’ll be opening new doors so we want to leave a fun memory worth looking back to, though to be honest, it hadn’t truly sunk in until recently and I still can’t imagine how it would be on that stage.  

**Yamashita Nanami (Yamashita):** I became more and more excited as the tour went on that I started to see ourselves standing on that Final Stage. Whenever we mention it during our shows, our fans would shout, “We’ll see you there!” and seeing that wellspring of support encourages me all the more. I’m glad that wherever we go, our fans are there to see us. Even my mom had gone to multiple shows aside from the one in our hometown of Tokushima, which was very heartwarming.  

**Takagi Miyu (Takagi):** Since this is the last time the seven of us get to tour from place to place, we wanted to make each and every visit especially memorable so we planned unique segments to keep things exciting and fresh, which I think our fans enjoyed. When we were at the Saitama Super Arena for a preliminary check, I went to one of the empty seats and looked at the stage and it hit me that it won’t be long until the seven of us will get to be on it.  

\[The planned segments were (Different per venue, usually with a member-in-charge): Karaoke Showcase, A continuation of 1st Live Tour’s Osaka Comedy Skit by Mayu, Kaya's Full choir, Miyu's DJ corner + Mochinage (Mochi throwing tradition), Airi's Dance Showcase, Christmas show, Separate Character and Solo Live Song Showcases, and a few very special and personal ones ([Part III Kumamoto Report here written by Instigare](http://oha.yoppi.moe/2019/01/05/yoshinos-tree/))\]  

**Okuno Kaya (Okuno):** I wanted to make the most of the time we spent on each and every stage. At the beginning of _Polaris_, where I would be at the back of the formation, I’d look at the girls and, each time, it dawns on me that it’s one less stage that we get to stand together. The tour is very memorable to me because it brought us to many places for the first time and even back to our beloved hometowns. I know it’s not ideal for the Final Live to be on the evening of a weekday \[Friday night\] because it would mean some of our fans would have to take time off from work but I’m very glad so many of them are coming.  

**\-- Can you name an experience that stood out among your six years of activities?**  

**Yamashita:** There’s so many but one that comes to mind is the free concert we did at Sendai International Airport. Experiencing a venue like that was out of the ordinary since it’s not necessarily a place where one would hold a live show but I’m glad we did because so many of our fans came and they were as lively as they have always been.  

**Okuno:** When we were starting out, we did an event where we designed a notebook with our fans.  

**Eino:** Right. That was so fun!  

**Okuno:** We were separated into groups, each designing a certain part of the notebook. Looking back, it was such a strange thing to do that it crossed my mind once when I was home alone and I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. (laughs) Around two hundred people attended it and hopefully, they've kept their notebook.  

**Yamashita:** We all put our heads together to design it and I still keep mine at home!  

**Takagi:** Maybe I’ll take mine out someday just to reminisce.  

**\-- How about you, Takagi-san?**  

**Takagi:** Mine would be _Animelo Summer Live 2018 -OK-_ and _Animax Musix 2018 Yokohama_. As an anisong and anime music fan, I dreamed to perform on those stages and getting to do it as WUG for the last time makes it very memorable, and I'm grateful that they’ve thought of different ways to send us off in light of our disbandment.  

**Eino:** I’m a fan of baseball so it would be the opening ceremonies in Sendai that we became a part of. Every year, we would collaborate with the _Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles_, and some of our members even opened by singing the national anthem. I’ll always treasure the uniforms and commemorative balls we’ve produced for them and those events will stay memorable to me as it had us do things that we were very unfamiliar with.  

**\-- Since you’ve gotten a lot of fans over the years, I would like to ask who they are to each of you.**  

**Eino:** It’s hard to describe in a few words but I never would have met them if it weren’t for WUG. They made WUG into what it is together with us and I can never be grateful enough.  

**Takagi:** We were able to get this far thanks to them and their ever-present support. Whenever we do our annual summer tour, we see them grow more and more and just knowing how many are there for us encouraged us to do even more for them.  

**Yamashita:** I’m very grateful to them in the sense that, through my six years as WUG, I was able to learn to appreciate and be considerate of the people who support me and what I do.  

**Okuno:** You can’t just call them fans of _Wake Up, Girls!_, the voice acting unit. They’re also part of our story and are together with us in making it.  

**\-- I think the many facets of _Wake Up, Girls!_ make it unique since there is the anime, and the unit, among others. In your own words, what to you is _Wake Up, Girls!_?**  

**Yamashita:** Going back to the title of our tour, HOME, I think of it as us preparing to spread our wings as we approach our Final Live. We started our careers as WUG and there's no better way to describe it other than “HOME”.  

**Okuno:** There’s definitely a familiar and comfortable feel to it.  

**Takagi:** A place that is warm and welcoming. I think that’s perfect.  

**Okuno:** I learned how to overcome so many challenges, no matter what or how hard it is, through my experiences in WUG. I’m sure a few years down the line when I feel down, it’ll be a reminder of why I’m here in the first place. I’d watch one of our Tour shows on Blu-ray or DVD and realize how much I persevered back then and that I should keeping doing the same.  

**WUG Songs Lasting For Years To Come...**

* * *

**\-- What do you think is WUG’s lasting legacy in the anime and music industry?**  

**Takagi:** All the songs MONACA made for us are so great that I think it left a lasting positive impression to anime and idol fans.  

**Eino:** Our songs will live on even after the group disbands so I hope that people will continue to listen and appreciate them even ten years into the future.  

**Yamashita:** The lyrics are down-to-earth and use words that are direct to the point. It never fails to encourage whenever we listen to them.  

**Okuno:** Our songs are the kind that support you when you encounter a barrier in life, but at the same time, won’t sugarcoat its words. I think that makes it timeless so I’ll be very glad if people keep listening to them.  

**\-- Since you’ve done of songs as WUG, I’d like to ask which one is memorable to each of you.**  

**Eino:** There's so many, it’s hard to pick one. (laughs)  

**Yamashita:** There were a lot of fun memories collaborating with May'n for _One In A Billion_. We had a dance involving the rolling pins that we called the "Bread Dance" though we only ended up mastering it on the day of the shoot for the music video. May'n was with us and though it was hectic, it was a lot of fun. It all became a reality in the first place because of May'n and her deep appreciation for us, and I like to think that its inclusion to our final album, _Wake Up, Best! MEMORIAL_, is a gesture of our gratitude to her.  

\[Keeping this short since I’ve made numerous footnotes in other Wake Up, May’n! (WUM) interviews but their collaboration with May’n is part serendipity and mutual appreciation that started in 2016’s _10th Anniversary Nendroid Live_ when she saw _Beyond the Bottom_ performed live. It was love at first sight that lead to the AnimeJAM suprise collaboration that lead to WUM and everything else after it.\]

**Okuno:** For me, it's _Non stop diamond hope_. Each of us had character-specific versions recorded for the album where the chorus is the same but the lyrics are different in all the verses. It expresses the deepest feelings of the characters we portray and shows off their unique personalities so I urge reading the lyrics while you listen to it.  

**Takagi:** Mine would be the songs that personally challenged me. _Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Chaos (Okamoto Miyu ver.)_ and _Regain Brave_. The former was sung as an insert cover song for the first season of the anime but that was recorded earlier in 2013. Since that was even before _Wake Up, Girls - 7 Idols_ (_Shichinin no Idol_) was released, and it was the first time I get to do a solo song, I was very nervous at the time. Listening to it now, I feel so embarrassed at how badly I delivered the ad lib lines in the interlude. (laughs) But at the same time, it's a pleasant reminder of where I came from.  

\[Staff commented about this in earlier interviews how Miyu, a fast learner who is eager and willing to try whatever is thrown at her, was asked to do the cover for _Taiyou Iwaku Moeyo Chaos_  in short notice but was able to pick things up quickly and pull it off in a day without any trouble.\]  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bCerrSXhw

**\-- And I believe** **_Regain Brave_** **is an insert song for** **_Wake Up, Girls! Shadow of Youth_** **(****_Seishun no Kage_****)...**  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEoLJxJO990

**Takagi:** It played a small part as background music during a scene involving bvex but it was the first time I didn't sing as my character. I was instructed to imitate various singers and learning how to do that was very fun.  

**Eino:** _Tunago_ was memorable for me, since it as a song you sing softly while thinking of your own hometown. I did the choreography and originally, a music video wasn't planned for it. But once it became part of AEON's _Nigiwai Tohoku_ Campaign \[A plan to revive Tohoku\], they decided to make one for it. It’s very memorable to me since it was the first time a song I choreographed had a music video. It's part of the Blu-ray addition to the album so I hope people watch it when they get the chance. It was recorded in various places in Miyagi Prefecture so maybe it could encourage you visit them.  

**Takagi:** We filmed in various places such as Ishinomaki.  

**Eino:** One of us even did a shoot inside an airport.  

**Takagi:** Since we're talking about music videos, _Koi de Ai de Boukun desu_'s shoot stands out as a fun one. We engaged in water gun battles and fought a mysterious battle with weapons, among other things. We filmed it at a large game center in Chiba and my highlights are the ridiculous displays of emotion we rarely show in our music videos.

**Giving Back To Fans As Voice Actresses**

* * *

**\-- Since the new songs that were recorded for your MEMORIAL album had lyrics written by Tadano Natsumi, who had done most of your songs, and entirely composed and arranged by different members of MONACA, I feel that these songs are filled with messages to your fans.**  

**Okuno:** _Umi Soshite Shutter Doori_ in particular bring up images of places of Tohoku near the ocean.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBx73ON\_2Rc

**Eino:** Recording that felt like I was singing to myself while walking in Sendai and other cities in Miyagi. The song itself has a melancholic air to it, which I think our fans would empathize with, but there’s also a measure of warmth in it that I know they will feel.  

**\--** **_Kotoba no Kesshou_** **sounds out of the ordinary.**  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE8QvaT9tQ0

**Eino:** Part of me feels grateful that MONACA’s Hirokawa Keiichi made this as his final song for us.  

**Yamashita:** It was difficult singing _Umi Soshite Shutter Dori_ and _Kotoba no Kesshou_. In _Kotoba no Kesshou_ in particular, getting the rhythm right was very tough. We had to be almost expressionless at the start of the song then go all out by the end. Expressing the extreme contrast between both ended up becoming quite challenging.  

**Okuno:** I think it truly shines when you see it live where you get to see its complicated choreography.  

**Takagi:** It has movements that are intense but end abruptly, and its pacing makes it very difficult to do well. The lyrics relate very much to what we feel as it speaks about our deeper thoughts.  

**Eino:** It’s about the six years we’ve spent together as a group.  

**\-- _Doyoubi no Flight_** **has a catchy yet nostalgic City Pop vibe to it. Not to mention, the day after your Final Live is a saturday.**  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrK28mYnyF4

**Takagi:** Tadano-sensei told us that she just picked the day on a whim so it’s completely coincidental!  

**Eino:** A very appropriate coincidence, though. Regardless, it's a great song.  

**Okuno:** This was the first song we recorded so I came face-to-face with the fact that we are disbanding. The first half of the song expresses our fears surrounding it while the latter half and the hook \[the interlude according the famitsu interview\] have us try to overcome those fears as we look forward to the future. Until then, I haven't conveyed those emotions through song so I was unsure how to express it. But through trial and error, I was slowly able to let it capture my emotions, and by the end, I could sing feeling warmer inside. This song is both melancholic yet inspiring at the same time.  

**Yamashita:** The choreography was done by someone who has been with us since the start. It includes ballet moves, our staple, so it feels like a song that has our signature style even when we show it live. There's a part in the interlude where Miyu and I will appear as if we're about to embrace, along with many other steps that express the bonds each of us share. It's an emotionally moving song, especially for us.  

**Takagi:** Even the lyrics doesn’t mince words.  

**Eino:** It’s emotionally impactful in the way it simply expresses things but the tune itself is quite catchy so it strikes a peculiar balance.  

**\-- While** **_Sayonara no Parade_** **contains an optimistic message as it puts everything to a close. It has lines from the opening theme of the anime and it gets quite emotional right at the end when you hear the final “Wake Up!”**  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48Nop\_WPKoo

**Takagi:** This song is a declaration of our resolve to keep moving forward.  

**Eino:** It feels like a culmination of everything we've done. This song is what finally made me feel that our time is coming to an end. That once we sing it, we’ll begin to disband as the unit. I want to sing it yet I also don't, which is both making me impatient and sad at the same time — sad since WUG would be ending but it also optimistic that we'll strive harder on the paths we've decided for ourselves as we move forward.  

**Okuno:** It's as much our song as it is our fans' and I imagine it as a parade where we usher them with us to welcome the future.  

**\-- It also seems to carry a message that you’ll see each other again somewhere.**  

**Yamashita:** There will always be the projects we worked on and since we’ll keep doing our solo activities, I’m sure that we’ll see each other, wherever it may be.  

**\-- Now that you're off to pursue your own paths, how do you imagine each of your futures will be?**  

**Eino:** I do have my fears since we've been helping each other up to this point. But we're opening new doors to the next part of our lives so I intend to put to use the skills I’ve learned as I patiently pursue the things I want realized. I don’t just want to do activities that anyone can do, I want to do things that would set me apart from everyone else. Create my own genre, so to speak.    

**Yamashita:** Our fans have supported us all throughout our six years as WUG. But as time goes, I can imagine those fans will begin to disappear so I want to give back the support they have given us all this time and hope that these new encounters will get them to appreciate the new me that I’ll show moving forward.  

I entered this industry originally because of my love of singing but I learned how to act through WUG and have grown to love it so I wish to find my purpose as a voice actress.  

**Takagi:** I intend to take up many more roles as a way for me to give back all the support our fans and people in the industry have given us. Through my interests in gaming and as an Anisong DJ, I want to earnestly pursue activities that represent who I am.  

**Okuno:** I think the best way for me to repay our fans’ support is through persevering in my voice work and landing all sorts of roles. I'll make them proud for keeping their faith in me.  

**\-- Now to close things off... Eino-san, on behalf of the unit, a word for our readers.**  

**Eino:** The curtain is about to close on our time as the unit, _Wake Up, Girls!_. While we do feel sad and lonely, we also feel eager to open new doors and begin to challenge ourselves once again. We intend to give our all so we hope you keep supporting us as you’ve always been. Let’s see each other again!!!
