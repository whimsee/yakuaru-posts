**\-- What were your first impressions on** **_One in a Billion_****?**  

May’n: It's quite a cute song. I feel honored that I got to work with Wake Up, Girls! (WUG) on a single and song's message about fateful encounters opening up new and exciting possibilities really resonates to me.  

Yamashita Nanami (Yamashita): I think it’s the perfect song for the anime, _Restaurant to Another World_ (_Isekai Shokudō_). It feels completely different from our usual songs. The melody is light and whimsical, and the lyrics are written with the anime’s themes in mind in that it uses words such as “Peko Peko” \[famished\], and “Delicious!”.  

Okuno Kaya (Okuno): It’s not an exaggeration when I say that the song holds a special meaning to me. When I first read the lines “_Kono hiroi sekai de kimi to meguriau_" \[To happen across a miraculous encounter in this huge world\], it reminded me how it sums up our encounter with May'n-chan. And I think the song is a perfect fit for the anime and a fitting debut for Wake Up, May’n!.  

\[Their initial encounter was in 2015 for video interview with WUG that May'n hosted where they talked about _Beyond the Bottom_. While they left a positive impression on her, it wasn't until the Nendroid live in 2016 where she first saw them perform live that she took notice of them and it was basically love at first sight.\]

**\-- How were the recording sessions?**  

May’n: My songs as May’n usually project a message of strength and the will to overcome adversity, but this one is an exception. I let myself feel lighthearted and excited. If I were to sing this as May'n, I would have added my personal interpretation to it but as WUM, I prioritized the general ideas of the song and the group.  

**\-- I did get the impression that your singing here was different from your usual songs.**  

May’n: It is a change of pace since the song has a clear image of delightful cheer. I hope I get the opportunity to sing it at a concert since I haven't smiled this much singing a song.

\[Sure enough, it became a staple in her setlist for a time especially following WUG's disbandment announcement and she ends every performance of it with a WUG sign.\]

**\-- How about you, Yamashita-san, Okuno-san?**  

Yamashita: There’s a part where I go “Suki Kirai” \[picky\]. That line uses the quirks of my voice, which I think gives it a unique “spice” to the song.  

May’n: When I first read that line, I was convinced that it must have been written just for you. And when we recorded together, it was like you're trying to sound extra cute.  

Yamashita: That happens whenever I get serious. (laughs) I also remember recording with all sorts of voices and microphone setups, which was a unique experience.  

Okuno: Throughout the entire process, from recording to finally hearing the final cut, I was just happy that I got to work with May’n-chan for a CD release. Her voice is so perfect for it. That time, I was recording with Airi (Eino Airi) and Miyu (Takagi Miyu) and the way our voices harmonized felt something new.  

**\-- Thank you for the insights. Can you tell me a part of the song that left an impression on you?**  

May'n: The line “_Watashi no futsuu kimi ni ha tondemo surprise ka mo!?_"\[I wonder what surprise is waiting for you!?\] completely sums up the song for me. It means that life is full of surprises. It's a song that never lets up on its excitement so I hope anyone who listens to this song will feel the same.  

Yamashita: My initial impression when I read the lyrics is that they sounded very pleasant and positive. But since WUG songs usually have lyrics that allude to themes of conflict and complicated emotions, it also has that in here. I'm glad that we were able to get together and make a song like this. It's cute and adorable, and it brings out a different side from all of us.  

[\[In another interview (click), they said that WUG songs differ because they're not always happy and pleasant. They always have an underlying layer of darker and more serious emotions that sometimes gets brought out by the lyrics, the composition, or both.\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Wake%20Up,%20Girls!%20Shin%20Shou%20animate%20Interview%20Series%20No.%2010%20(12-26-2017))  

Okuno: The way the lines were divided were also different from our usual. Our pattern usually goes from solo to pairs, then all together. But it's somewhat complex for this song.  
  
If you listen closely to the recorded version, you should be able to pick out who sang which line but watch it live so you can confirm it for yourselves.  

\[This also gets a bit of an explanation in a Polaris interview, another song with a different singing pattern. The composer/arranger usually decides the order based on the singer's voice that they had in mind. For Polaris' verses, they let Mayu decide on the order but the emotional tone they wanted a pitch pattern of high to low then quickly rising to high, so it always started with Yoppi before reaching a low point with Airi then Miyu and Minami punctuating as it hits the chorus. There was no Mayu solo until the end. She insisted on it since she wrote verse lines that she felt would fit each member with their suggestions in mind and left herself out until the final solo.\]  

**\-- Let's talk about the music video. I have to say, my initial impression was that Okuno-san seemed a little different here from usual.**  

Okuno: Yeah. I didn’t have to project myself as Kikuma Kaya this time so I was able to express myself differently. Usually, I have to present a cool persona and sing in my character's voice for WUG songs and music videos. I guess you could say that I wanted to add my own personal influence to it as WUM for _One in a Billion_.  

[\[In another interview, they mentioned in passing that Kaya, like Mayu, just recently broke out of her shell. She also went through the same identity crisis as Mayu (and even May'n when she took a hiatus in 2015) and decided in 2017 to be more like her ideal self, and express her own charm during performances instead of relying on her fictional persona (Which manifested in 4th live esp. "Arigatou!" during 16yr old Agape and Final Tour).\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Aoyama%20Yoshino,%20Eino%20Airi,%20and%20Yamashita%20Nanami%20MyNavi%20Interview%20(11-29-2017))  

**\-- I see. How about you two? What how did the shoot go?**  

Yamashita: The mood that day was full of excitement and good vibes. There's a cut where we did choreographed motions behind a table with a rolling pin but on the day of the shoot, we didn’t have it memorized yet so we scrambled to master the motions. The shoot was a lot of fun and I hope that energy comes across in the final version.  

May'n: I've never been in a shoot this complex but it went smoothly because everyone was so adorably cute and on-point.

**\-- We finally get to see the full version with this release. Which part of the music do you want everyone to keep an eye on?**  

![](/images/1502072276_1_7_bf0135b4b891ffb10fc3a8b87d2a8929.jpg)

Yamashita: I'd look out for the "Peco Peco" and "Doki doki" inserts. Each has a cut of one of us making cute expressions while presenting a plate with characters written on it.  

May'n: The music video has a narrative about a young boy from another world. He stumbles to the restaurant hungry and the girls decide to take him in and cook for him. By the end, he has a very satisfied look on his face as he takes a bite out of the final dish. You can see from our expressions that it’s not just him who feels fortunate for the encounter but us as well.  

**\-- Now, a question for May'n-san. How was it working with WUG?**  

May'n: It felt just like when I watched them perform on stage, only this time I get to be part of it. Each member has their own unique intense passionate energy that I'm sure their fans also feel. It’s because of that we were able to make this a reality and the experience deepened my impressions about them.  
  
I’ve been a solo artist for a long time and as one, I usually work things out on my own. But being in a group is different. Everything is shared. Your struggles, dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Everyone helps each other to achieve them. I really felt the sense of unity WUG has that makes them unique.  

**\-- And you strongly felt it with them throughout the shoot?**  

May'n: Yes. As WUM, I was able to experience how different it was. For instance, I saw how considerate the members were with each other. In a solo shoot, you just have to be at your best and you can start over if you're not satisfied with the result. But in a group, you can't just think about your own performance. You also have to make sure that everyone around you is at their best. What I find admirable about them is they exchange ideas and opinions on each others' parts. You could really feel that the shoot was as much their work as it was everyone else's.  

**\-- I'll pose the same question to you, Yamashita-san and Okuno-san. How was it working with May'n-san?**  

Yamashita: It goes without saying that she's a fantastic singer, but I think being around her taught me an important lesson and that is to be open and upfront about what you love. I learned that her favorite food is taiyaki and she kickboxes as a hobby.  
  
She's someone who is confident showing herself to everyone. Her open admiration for us lead to WUM, so I want to take that to heart and muster the courage to be more open about my interests.  

\[May'n mentioned in an interview that there are countless kinds of taiyaki, depending on the region and even whoever's selling it, so she would always sample the local variety anywhere she goes.  
  
As for Nanami's interests, she often writes in the blog about clothes and earrings, among other things before like aromatherapy and her handmade stuffed rabbit that she brings everywhere. She usually has something to say about the clothes (and earrings) she bought, often realizing that she forgets about buying them online (Sometimes from Korea) until it arrives. She wrote as 2016's new year's resolution that she should probably stop doing retail therapy whenever she gets stressed out so she can save up more.\]  

Okuno: One incident stands out for me. When we were first getting to know each other, Yoppi and Miyu immediately approached her and started calling her "May'n-chan, May'n-chan", which struck me as odd because I thought, ”shouldn't we address her more formally first?”  

May'n: (laughs)  

![](/images/1502072276_1_10_79179a8b45623ecebb6e5a9b8a1aa003.jpg)

Okuno: So I got jealous and during a break at our shoot, I asked her if I could call her "May'n-chan" as well and she said it was okay!  
  
What I admire about her is her genuineness. I'm the closest to her in terms of age but she made me realize that there's so much I've yet to learn about myself. She always projects a positive aura and keeps a smile on her face. And the way she carries herself around the people she works with is something I wish to learn from and apply for myself.  

May'n: I think the reason why I'm smiling so much is that I'm with you girls. (laughs)  

**\-- Let's talk about the title "One in a Billion". Taken literally, it means a possibility of one out of a billion, but I want to ask about the deeper meaning it has.**  

May'n: An occurrence like that is nothing short of a miracle. Actually, the working title was "One in a Million", so now it's even more so. I believe that first encounters are one of a kind, each one a miracle that should be cherished.  

**\-- Thank you. Now that we've reached the end of the interview, any final thoughts and messages for the upcoming release event on August 9** **\[a free admission live event\]****?**  

May'n: You don't usually see a group of 8 perform on stage so I want everyone to come.  

Yamashita: Having the opportunity to sing together with May'n-san is like a once-in-a-lifetime experience so I want to make the moment count. Not only is she a wonderful singer, all of this became a reality because she believes in us and wants to connect to our fans so I want to do my best to repay that support.  

Okuno: We'll make this event something that will make fans want to hear more WUM songs.  

**\-- Thank you for voicing your thoughts for this interview.**
