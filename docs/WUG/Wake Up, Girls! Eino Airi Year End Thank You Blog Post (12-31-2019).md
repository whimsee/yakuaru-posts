**Thank you 2019**

Good evening!  
  
This is Eino Airi \*✲ﾟ\*( \*´﹀\` )\*✲ﾟ\*  
  
I know I just did a post a while ago but I would appreciate it if you all read this as well.  
  
We’re closing in on the end of the year.  
Perhaps it’s still too early to ask but how was your 2019?  
How are you spending New Year's Eve?  
  
Looking back… If I were to sum up 2019 in one word, it would be “Eventful”.  
It had been a great year. If you don’t mind me getting abstract, it felt as if it’s the shortest year of my life thus far and yet it was a bustle of activity, with each moment being significant in its own way.   
  
To be realistic, the biggest change was the fact that I’m doing solo activities now and it still amazes me that it all happened this year.  
  
Opening new doors and choosing to walk a path takes hope and creates expectations with anxiety following not too far behind. That’s what I felt when I started. I took many things into consideration while staying realistic and true to myself, sticking to beliefs and aspirations I hold dear. It was the compass I held close as it lead the way for a fruitful year that I can proudly call my own.  
  
I’m grateful for the numerous baseball-related projects I took part in, especially with the Rakuten Golden Eagles and I can’t even describe how happy I am working with them.  
  
I’m grateful to have gotten more opportunities to do stage plays as it was something I wanted to do more of. The numerous roles I did taught me so much as it brought me new experiences which opened my mind to new possibilities. 赤月暮羽、ルクル、ばあや, I’m so glad to have met you. It’s such a joy being you. Let’s work together again in the future!  
  
I won’t be able to name them all but I was just as busy the entire year doing all sorts of work in various fields where I was able to show different sides of myself: パっとUP、あれかこれか、月刊永野愛理. They all mean so much to me. Thank you.   
  
Many thanks as well to the rest of the projects I’ve been part of this year.  
  
I wouldn’t have been able to do this on my own.  
I have my manager, the staff I have worked with, and my ever-supportive family and friends.  
You’re all wonderful. Thank you for always being there.  
  
And of course, how could I forget anyone who is reading this right now? Words cannot express how grateful I am. I’m here because of you. Your smiles power mine and it encourages me to do that much better to earn that support!!  
  
Look forward to what I’ll do next! I hope you feel just how grateful I am right now but I’ll make sure to make that sentiment clear!  
  
I sure have grown a lot this year. It feels fulfilling!  
Everyone, thank you and let’s see each other again next year.  
Let’s make next year’s goals a reality!!!  
  
Let’s make 2020 a stellar one ⭐︎  
  
Happy new year ଘ(੭ˊ꒳​ˋ)੭✧  
  
Like a SAKURA 🌸
