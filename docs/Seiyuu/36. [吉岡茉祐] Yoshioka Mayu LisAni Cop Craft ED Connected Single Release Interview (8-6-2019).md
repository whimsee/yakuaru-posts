_Cop Craft_, a light novel series written by Gatoh Shoji, is a buddy cop story that follows veteran detective Kei Matoba and Tilarna Exedilica, a knight from another world, as they solve various crimes in an island city with a fantastical premise. 

Since July, it is being broadcast as an anime, and to commemorate the single release of its ending theme _Connected_, I invited Yoshioka Mayu, Tilarna’s voice actress, to answer a few questions pertaining to it.

* * *

**\-- I want to ask about your role as both the main heroine and performer of the ending theme of _Cop Craft_****. I imagine this must be very significant for you.**

**Yoshioka Mayu (YM):** Actually, those came as pleasant news to me on two separate occasions. (laughs) Being selected for the role of Tilarna came first, then as we wrapped up recording the first episode, they approached me about performing the ending theme.

**\-- Didn’t you live-tweet your impressions during the broadcast of the episode as well?**

**YM:** It was a completely new experience! I was hoping to do it someday for an anime I’m in but I didn’t expect it to actually happen so soon. _Cop Craft_ also brought with it other new experiences, namely being the sole main heroine and hosting a radio show to promote it, among other things.

**\-- About that, is there a specific experience that sticks out to you?**

**YM:** The recording environment took some getting used to because of the cast. A lot of them are experienced at doing voice dubs for foreign movies and TV shows, and there’s only a few female and younger members like me so the mood tends to be more settled in, as it were. Something between professional and relaxed. (laughs) That said, whenever Takagi Wataru-san, who voices Biz O’Neill, gets to perform, it’s always so hilarious and I’ve never laughed that much in those settings before.

**\-- Since the recording environment is so different, did that mean it also expected a different style of acting?**

**YM:** They wanted a style that is reminiscent of foreign works where you don’t rely on doing different voices and instead aim for a more natural-sounding delivery, as if you’re just making regular conversation. It was definitely new for me. I learned a lot in the process and it’s thanks to that Tilarna was able to naturally express her noble upbringing as well as her sense of maturity.

**\-- In your own words, how would you describe Tilarna?**

**YM:** Beneath her cute exterior, she has a dignified air about her because in her world, _Leto Semani_, she’s 27 years old and a knight but also a maiden at heart. 

**\-- I think she’s cute in some aspects as well, especially in Episode 1 where she gets uncontrollably curious with the elevator and the car that she got herself into trouble.**

**YM:** That’s right. She’s deeply inquisitive and full of questions, having arrived to a completely different world. As someone who also tries all sorts of things regardless of what it is, I can relate to that feeling. That and the fact that we’re both terrible at cooking. (laughs)

**\-- What can you say about Tsuda Kenjiro-san, who voices Tilarna’s buddy Kei Matoba?**

**YM:** Tsuda-san is quite a lighthearted person. That’s the impression I got from our numerous interactions but once he’s on the mic, he can be very cool and impressive, to the point that you know you can rely on him to cover your back.

**\-- That sounds just like Kei Matoba, don’t you agree?**

**YM:** It does describe him perfectly, though, Tsuda-san also has a funny side. The recording booth we’re using is quite new and modern so during episode 1's recording, everyone was impressed and careful the whole time… until Tsuda-san spilled his coffee. (laughs) But that kind of goofiness is what makes him a funny and wonderful person. 

**\-- I never would have imagined that out of him. (laughs) Let’s talk about the Farbani language since it’s used in both the anime and the music made for it. This might have an obvious answer but I want to ask, what kind of language is it?**

**YM:** It’s a language from Tilarna’s home in the other world, Farbani Kingdom. People from that world don’t have a phonetic “P” sound so they would pronounce words like “Policeman” as “Boliceman”, which is something that gets shown pretty clearly in the anime. Only Gatoh-sensei knows for sure about the ins and outs of it but personally, I think the sentence construction leans more closely to English, while the pronunciation is more similar to German, which got me to use some of the German I learned in College since I took that up as one of my majors.

**\-- It must be difficult trying to speak a fictional language.**

**YM:** It was challenging. Gatoh-sensei tried to help me with a device that I can listen to as a pronunciation guide but at first, he actually came up to tell me how hopeless I was at it. (laughs) I got better as it went on and by the end, I’m happy to say he complimented me on my improvement.

**\-- Do other characters speak Farbani?** 

**YM:** Zelada and the Vampire speak Farbani which their voice actors, Hōchū Ōtsuka-san and Uesaka-san respectively, did an exceptional performance of. Especially Uesaka-san; maybe her experience with Russian gave her some insight about languages but the way she spoke almost makes you think she’s from that world. Both her character and Tilarna come from different generations so there is actually a distinction in the way they speak that I hope we were able to properly exhibit.

**\-- Let's talk about the ending theme _Connected_** **which also has Farbani in the lyrics. Since it was done by Hawaiian6’s Yasuno Yuta, I feel like it hits with an intensity that you don’t usually expect from an ending theme.**

**YM:** It caught me by surprise when I listened to it for the first time. I was expecting a more cutesy ballad since Tilarna would be singing but it ended up being a cool band-style arrangement. I'm a huge fan of that style and whenever I get a chance to do a solo song, I would always try and ask for that kind of arrangement.

**\-- If you don’t mind going off-topic, what genre do you usually listen to?**

**YM:** I enjoy Traditional Japanese Rock. That’s why I’m grateful that _Connected_ turned out to be that kind of song.

**\-- I can see that, though I imagine singing as Tilarna must have come with its own challenges.**

**YM:** I didn’t have to change my voice that much for her so I was able to sing it the way I wanted, which isn’t something I can say when I sing with a cute voice as it can be a struggle. That said, there were finer technical aspects to it that did make it challenging, such as the use of vibrato for example.

**\-- How about the Farbani at the beginning?**

**YM:** Those are _Neeve Shieya_, which means “Good night” or “Sweet dreams,” and _Dasshu Zanna_, which means ”Thank you.” They’re used frequently in the anime so I felt comfortable singing and fitting them with the melody.

\[Despite being used frequently, as of yet, there’s no official romanized spelling for ネーヴェ・シーヤ and ダーシュ・ザンナ but they can be roughly written as _Neeve Shieya_ and _Dasshu Zanna_ respectively.\]

**\-- Is there anything more about the song that you want to highlight?**

**YM:** It’s in the full version but the thumping build up as it enters the final chorus “_tsurai kakko wo uketome_” really hypes me up. It’s like a cue that I’m waiting for before I really go all out. It makes me excited to sing this with a live band someday.

**\-- I’ll be looking forward to it. Next, I want to ask about the song coupled with this single, _Nonfiction_****. If I were to compare both, this one feels even more of an ending theme.**

**YM:** The arrangement definitely lends to it. Compared to _Connected_, which emphasized Tilarna’s sense of nobility, _Nonfiction_ expresses more of her feminine side. Thinking of it that way gives both songs a deeper meaning so I recommend listening to _Connected_ in Episode 1 and _Nonfiction_ by Episode 12. RIRIKO-san, who wrote and composed it, actually read through the source material, so she was able to incorporate themes from Cop Craft’s world concept and included lots of references to specific events.

**\-- Some of the lines seem to read like poetry. What can you say about them?**

**YM:** Those spoken lines were difficult to do while singing so we recorded them separately. It’s strange how surreal it sounds even though my voice was used for all of them. It is meant to be heard clearly since it conveys more of Tilarna’s character as well as serve as a backdrop for the rest of the song. It’s such a great song and it matches the anime perfectly that I think it’s a shame if it weren't there.

**\-- I'd love to hear it being played somewhere in that world too.**

YM: (whispers) I know, right… That’s why I asked if they could play in a certain scene and they said they will. (laughs)

**\-- Now that's worth keeping an eye out for in future episodes!**
