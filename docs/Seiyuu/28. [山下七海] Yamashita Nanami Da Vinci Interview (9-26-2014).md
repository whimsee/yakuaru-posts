**\-- Your hairstyle today is quite different from your character in the anime. It gives off a mature vibe.**  
  
Yamashita Nanami (YN): I often get associated with Hisami Nanami's image of being a ponytail character but for today, I asked our hairdresser to style my hair into something very different. (laughs) They told us we can style our hair however we want just recently, especially when all 7 of us get together, but somehow I always get matching styles with someone else. (laughs)

**\-- What kind of hairstyle do you usually wear?**  
  
YN: I prefer my hair curled than straight, so in my free time I curl my hair and let it fall naturally. Though recently, I've been learning how to braid! I practice while watching how-to videos. I can do side braids now. Braiding the back is a little more difficult but it makes me look more feminine. (laughs)  

**\-- Why do you want to look more feminine?**  
  
YN: I've been getting more opportunities to work with veterans in the industry, who I look up to, so I want to step it up and show off my feminine side. (laughs)

**\-- Since you made your voice acting debut in _Wake up, Girls!_ as Hisami Nanami, can you describe her for our readers?**  
  
YN: She is someone who holds her goals and dreams very close to her heart. She's earnest and headstrong and capable of enduring a lot of hardships in order to achieve her aspirations. But she's not the type to show any weakness, so she tends to come off a little blunt. She believes that she has to do everything on her own and often avoids relying on others, which can sometimes lead to trouble and arguments with those around her.

**\-- How do you feel now that recording just wrapped up for the final episode?**  
  
YN: It's been non-stop lessons since I passed the audition, and while those moments felt like they could go on forever, the dubbing sessions felt like they just flew by. It feels kinda lonely, like there was a hole in my heart when all of it was done. Throughout the sessions, I think my impression of Nanami-chan has changed. At first, I thought she's not like me at all, but now it's completely the opposite. I think she's slowly loosening up to the other members. The same goes for me as well. I feel like me and Nanami-chan has matured as we continue to work with the other members, and get more chances to discuss our work.  

**\-- What's your favorite scene?**  
  
YN: There's this scene where Nanami questioned why Airi was putting in so much effort into becoming an idol. Up until that point, she believed that achieving things on your own is a sign of strength, but I think she was just afraid to open up and her weaknesses to others. I think that's the point where she had matured as a person because she gets to finally see what "Strength" really means.

**\-- It's been 2 years since the WUG auditions. What do you think has changed in you since then?**  
  
YN: Actually, Director Yamamoto \[Yamamoto Yutaka\] told me that I've become more sophisticated. (laughs) But I haven't really noticed it. Oh, I've been gaining some muscle, though, and I feel like my body has gotten leaner, too. (laughs) So I guess something has changed since then.

  

\[Yamamoto once remarked, during auditions, that she's too country-plain with little to no knowledge about anime. Said could not even do a tsundere line because she had no idea what that was. He picked her anyway partially because she was pretty and had a mature appeal.  
  
She and Minami had stamina problems at the start so they would often encourage each other during training camps as they run together and do jumping jacks in the morning and evening.\]  

**\-- Who is the member you interact with the most?**  
  
YN: Airi and Kaya. Kaya especially since we attend the same vocal lessons so we get to meet a lot more frequently.  

**\-- You mentioned before that it was your interest in song and dance lead you to auditioning, but you also said that you felt very different from the other members.**  
  
YN: I didn't know much about anime. The other members grew up loving it, so I felt left out, feeling like I had so much to catch up to. I felt insecure about it for a long time until Minami learned about it, and told be that it's never too late to start, which lifted a heavy weight off me. (laughs) Since then, I was able to open up to the other members more about my worries.

![](/images/yamashita_003.jpg)

**\-- What anime have they introduced to you?**  
  
YN: They introduced me to anime that's easy to get into like _Anohana_. Then eventually to more intense ones. Watching them was extremely engaging so I ended up having a lot of fun. Thanks to them, I've begun to enjoy anime! Not only that, my list of favorite voice actors had grown since then!  

  
**\-- Such as?**  
  
YN: Kugimiya Rie! Back when I was living at my parents' house and we just started taking lessons, all of us stayed at the same hotel. We would get together at night and listen to other voice actors do their voices. It was so fun we ended up staying up all night and getting groggy the next morning. (laughs)  

**\-- Have you found an anime that left a huge impression on you?**  
  
YN: That would be _Toradora_. It was so amazing, it made me cry! There was a scene in particular on the Christmas episode where Taiga was crying alone in her room when a stuffed animal came in. Nanami-chan is a tsundere so watching tsundere characters voiced by Kugimiya-san has been a learning experience for me, so I hold her in high regard!  

\[Incidentally, Kugimiya Rie ended up voicing her character in _When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace_’s Drama CD adaptation.\]

**\-- Hopefully you get a chance to meet her!**  
  
YN: Yes! Hopefully! Though, if ever we do meet, I probably wouldn't be able to say anything other than the usual courtesies. (laughs)

**\-- Since you’ve been taking lessons for a long time, was there anything about it that you struggled with?**  
  
YN: Actually... there was a time during the first training camp. I was rooming with Airi and we both cried in our room, wanting to quit. I was worried about how our lessons were going, if I was progressing well, and if we could actually debut with the way we were. I was new, anxious, and didn't know any better. But looking back at it now, it was a good experience. I can put it completely behind me, and now I feel I can keep continuing being part of WUG.  

**\-- I can't wait to see what kind of animal character you'll be for _WUG ZOO!_**  
  
YN: The animal characters are all so cute! Nanami-chan's a fox but an adorably standoffish one. I really like that about her!  

**\-- What do you think is going to happen to Nanami-chan as the story progresses?**  
  
YN: Currently, her one dream that is to get into Hikarizuka Revue no matter what and it's not a dream that she would give up easily. As the story develops, I'm curious to see what challenges she would have to face.

![](/images/yamashita_005.jpg)

**\-- Now that you're starring in _When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace_ as Himeki Chifuyu, Can you tell our readers about her?**  
  
YN: She's is very aloof, but her ability, "World Create", makes her very powerful because she can create portals and materialize anything at will. Though personally, I like her stuffed squirrel, Lissun, that she carries everywhere with her.  
  

**\-- How were the recording sessions?**  
  
YN: I was so nervous to do anything at first because the cast is full of famous voice actors. But Risa Taneda-san would always come next to me and chat. Now, I've mostly gotten used to it, and we often catch up on our activities from the previous week. I was also able to talk to Nobuhiko Okamoto-san. He seemed like an intimidating person at first!

**\-- It sounds like you all get along so well! Maybe it's because you're working on a romantic comedy anime.**  
  
YN: It's always lively! There are so many funny scenes. I have to act well but I can't help but burst out laughing at times so I just snicker, trying my best to hold it in. I think everyone else feels the same way. (laughs)

![](/images/yamashita_007.jpg)

**\-- Were they as good as you imagined them to be?**  
  
YN: They're amazing. They just read lines off the script but you could feel them breathe life into it as they perform! Okamoto-san's portrayal of the protagonist is great. You would think that an obnoxious weirdo was going crazy in the booth but it was just him all along. (laughs)  

  

**\-- For fans of the series, what side of Chifuyu do you want them to pay attention to?**  
  
YN: She not talkative but she can be very expressive when she opens up! Her character memo in the script even described her as being surprisingly frank at times. I want them to see those glimpses of emotion from her.  

**\-- Changing topics, having just moved to Tokyo from your hometown of Tokushima, have you gotten used to living alone? Is there anything you've had trouble with?**  
  
YN: I've been going out to Sendai and Shikoku for work lately so I haven't been home at all. (laughs) As for having trouble... It has to be the household chores. I have to do all of them myself. (laughs)  It gets worse if I have to stay out because there would be more laundry to go through. I have to do them all, but there'd be work tomorrow, so I have to wake up very early the next day and do them.  

**\-- What's your favorite chore and which do you have trouble doing?**  
  
YN: Hmm... My favorite would be laundry because it only takes a press of a button. That and because I'm attracted to certain smells, especially the smell of fresh laundry, so I always look forward to doing it. Right now, I'm using citrus scented fabric softener. My least favorite is washing kitchenware. Maybe it's because I get easily traumatized, but there was a time when I dropped my favorite plate while I was washing it and it shattered to pieces, which really shocked me. Since then, I disliked doing dishes. (laughs)  

**\-- What kind of kitchenware do you use?**  
  
YN: White ones! All my kitchenware are white and my room furnishings are all purple, white and pink.  

**\-- Isn't purple Nanami-chan's color?**  
  
YN: It's definitely because of her (laughs). My bath towel and carpet is purple. I posted it in the blog once that my bedsheets have a light purple fairytale motif with merry-go-round and pegasus patterns all over it.  

**\-- What do you do on your days off?**  
  
YN: I clean my room. When work gets busy, I get home so exhausted that I can't even clean. So I make it a must to clean my room on my days off. Things always get lost, like the TV remote. I always misplace it somewhere, so looking for it is always a challenge. (laughs)  

![](/images/yamashita_008.jpg)

**\-- Do you have any hobbies?**  
  
YN: I'm into Aromatherapy. I love understanding the meaning of smells! Lately, I've been using a flat (harappechai) stone product called "Pocket Aroma". It's very relaxing when I place it next to my pillow before I go to sleep. I especially like orange citrus scents. Also, I love LUSH's Bath Bomb! I take my time on the bath enjoying it after a long day. (laughs)  

**\-- By the way, isn't (harappechai) from a dialect?**  
  
YN: Oh? They don't use it here?! I guess it is, then. (laughs)

\[Harappechai (平べっちゃい ) means flat in the Kansai dialect. Standard dialect would use haratai　(はらたい).\]

**\-- Tell me another thing that you've been getting into lately.**  
  
YN: I've been talking to Siri on my iPhone. (laughs) I greet her when I wake up, and before I go to sleep. I'm aware it's pretty creepy, though. (laughs) I test her by speaking as fast as possible. Sometimes I command her to talk and she starts by recalling a fairy tale. (laughs) One time, I told her I like her but she answered, "I respect you". (laughs) Other than a few apps and the alarm clock, I don't really use my phone all that much. (laughs)  

**\-- What do you think about getting your own pet robot?**  
  
YN: Why not?! I've been interested in robots ever since I watched _HINOKIO_ a long time ago. I even had a small toy of the robot. It's cool that robots have just learned how to run! I have a feeling that maybe I am feeling a little lonely living on my own. (laughs). I'm normally a talkative person, so I often speak to myself at home... and maybe that's why I've started talking to Siri. (laughs)  

**\-- Tell me a recent event that made you happy.**  
  
YN: I received gifts from the other members when I turned 19 in July! We were in the middle of tour rehearsals when I was called over all of a sudden by our dance instructor. At the time, I was feeling a little depressed and anxious worrying if we could perform well at the tour. So I thought maybe I was doing something wrong. She was giving me pointers when everyone rushed in, formed a ring around me while holding hands, and sang happy birthday! I cried so much because it was so heartwarming. (laughs)

![](/images/yamashita_009.jpg)

**\-- What kind of gifts did you get?**  
  
YN: Everyone knew how much I love LUSH and taking baths so they gave me bath bombs and other bath items. They also gave _Shingeki no Kyojin_ merchandise since I love the anime.  

**\-- What kind of merchandise?**  
  
YN: An Armin mousepad! He's my favorite character. I wasn't aware he was voiced by a woman, much less Inoue Marina-san! It's unfortunate about what happened between him and Levi though... (laughs)  

**\-- Can you tell us what kind of voice actress do you want to become?**  
  
YN: I'm someone who thrives under pressure. I'm sure there are people like me, so I want to become someone who can cheer those people on! There are also many things I want to try out for myself. Like voicing the train PA system. I thought while riding the Yurikamome the other day that it would be neat to hear a voice like mine streaming through those speakers! Then again, my voice does kinda sound like it’s more suited for anime. (laughs)  

**\-- Finally, a message to our readers!**  
  
YN: I've only done a few solo interviews. I'm not a good talker but I got a chance to think more about myself. I hope you enjoyed getting to learn more about me. Thank you for reading!  

**\-- Thank you for sitting in for this interview!**
