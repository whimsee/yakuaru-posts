This short interview is essentially a promotion for _Kirin Ichiban Shibori_ where Takahashi Rie enjoys a cold one while talking about the product, then later alcohol-related anecdotes about her work and personal life.

For context, this was conducted during Japan’s COVID-19 lockdown period where most people were strongly advised to stay home and conduct business remotely whenever possible.

**Pair your meals with** **_Ichiban Shibori_**

* * *

**\-- Now that we’re here, I was thinking we should have some** **_Ichiban Shibori_** **while we chat.**

**Takahashi Rie (TR):** (Looks at a glass of _Ichiban Shibori_) That froth is tempting! Can I drink it?

**\-- You’re more than welcome to.**

**TR:** Great! Don’t mind if I do! … It’s so good!

**\-- It seemed like you’ve been meaning to have some during the photo shoot, so I can only imagine it tastes that much better now. Do you usually drink _Ichiban Shibori_****?**

**TR:** I don’t really consider the brand all that much when it comes to beer. At an izakaya, for example, the more experienced ones in the group would order and I’d just follow suit; that’s pretty much how I started drinking it, which left me with the impression that beer is just beer.

But that doesn’t mean I haven’t had one that was satisfying after just one glass, or one that I’d keep coming back to. Now that I’ve had _Ichiban Shibori_ again, I can say it doesn’t taste too strong or too harsh, making it easy to drink in one gulp. You can even pair this with a meal. There are beers that don’t really go well with food; I prefer having something on the side, so this is perfect for me. So for those who feel that all beer’s the same, _Ichiban Shibori_’s taste doesn’t disappoint and I encourage giving it a shot.

**\-- Since you have a cooking show on NicoNico called** **_Takahashi Rie no konban nani tsukuro?_****, what kind of dish would you prepare to go with** **_Ichiban Shibori_****?**
  
**TR:** Good question… Yakitori… isn’t something I’d cook by myself. (laughs) I’d lose my appetite. (laughs) I like beer with something that has a strong taste and I prefer non-salty yakitori sauce, so if it’s just me, I’d probably make yakitori-don or any dish that looks like it’s glistening. Also, this counts as something I wouldn’t make on my own but sushi works as well.

**\--** **_Ichiban Shibori_****’s agreeable taste does make it good with sushi.**

**TR:** And good sushi places serve beverages in immaculately spotless drinking glasses, as opposed to mugs that you would find in yakitori places. So I’d rather prefer drinking _Ichiban Shibori_ from a nice beer glass instead.

**\-- Actually, there are vintage _Ichiban Shibori_** **beer glasses out there. It’s specially designed to wring out the most flavor; drinking from it apparently tips the liquid just so straight through the middle of your tongue, resulting in a flavorful swig.**

**TR:** How clever! I sure could use one of those. I’ve been meaning to get my own glass now that I’ve been drinking at home more often, though I like the “I’m a working class woman!” vibe you get from drinking straight from the can. (laughs)

**What character would you have** **_Ichiban Shibori_** **with?**

* * *

**\-- I imagine you normally get to have beer at drinking parties among fellow cast members and staff, right?**

**TR:** That’s right. I’d also swing by a convenience store after a hard day to grab a can to reward myself. A lot of the anime I voice gets broadcast late at night so I’d often crack open a cold one while waiting for it to come on or as I watch.

It’s immensely fulfilling watching the things I’ve worked on and beer enhances that sensation, especially when it comes to comedies like _Konosuba_.

**\-- Well, there** **_is_** **a lot of drinking in Konosuba. (laughs) Now, among the characters you’ve portrayed, which of them would you like to drink with? You may include those who are underaged, assuming they’ve grown up by then.**

**TR:** Oh! Let’s see… Actually, since _Re:Zero_’s Emilia had a drinking scene in the OVA _Memory Snow_, and just like her, alcohol gets me to loosen up, I’d want to do it with her.

I can also imagine Megumin enjoying a good drink once she gets older. Emilia and I would quietly listen to her soapbox as she gets going, then she would graciously try to get us to settle down when it’s our turn.

**\-- I can see that. Megumin can be surprisingly level-headed.**

**TR:** Exactly! That is if you forget the fact that she uses explosion magic and is part of the Crimson Demon Clan. (laughs) She’s a straightforward and sensible girl, and with the three of us in _Isekai Quartet_, I’d be great if we could have drinks together.

**\-- I’m curious to see how that goes. (laughs) Do you still remember your first beer drinking experience?**

**TR:** That would be at a soccer stadium with my parents because they wanted to witness it. I’ve had a few sips before that but we had no idea where my limit was, which ended up being more than my dad’s. (laughs)

**\-- Do you still drink beer with your parents?**

**TR**: My dad isn’t much of a drinker but my mom is, so we often drink together. It’s become somewhat of a thing we do after dinner. (laughs) It’s very fun; I wouldn’t exactly call it giving back but my mom’s gone through a lot. Now that I can drink alcohol, I’d like us to enjoy her second, perhaps third chapter of her life spending time together like that.

**\-- How endearing. Now, if you had a can of _Ichiban Shibori_** **to give as a present, who would you give it to?**

**TR:** I would be to my manager, who actually loves _Shibori Ichiban_! My manager’s always been there supporting me so I’d like it if I could do that whenever I can to show how grateful I am. 

**A refreshed sigh after having** **_Ichiban Shibori_**

* * *

**\-- By the way, it looks like you’re about to finish your glass.**

**TR:** Yeah. (laughs) It’s really good, I can’t help myself.

**\-- Since** **_Ichiban Shibori_** **is a great choice for drinking at home, especially with family, have you had any online drinking parties during this stay-at-home period?**

**TR:** I have on a regular basis! It started between me and my agency-mate Ueda Reina-chan. She’d have sweet sake, I’d have beer, and we’d talk and share opinions about all sorts of things, especially with what’s been happening lately.

It really got me thinking about the people that I love chatting with; they’re probably the ones I want to be with the most. But of course I’m also dying to celebrate a toast with the anime cast and production staff for a job well done.

**\-- Times like these make it really poignant how people get together to drink.**

**TR:** I'd usually go out for drinks with other voice actors after a dubbing session. But now that we’re all set up to do everything alone, I’d wrap up my recording and pass the buck to the next person, and all we can really do is share pleasantries and wave goodbye, which is quite sad… These circumstances truly hit home how important it is to get everyone to chat over a few drinks after making something together.  

**\-- Can you share any drinking party anecdotes?**

**TR:** Since getting things done is the top priority at any recording session, drinking parties are a sure-fire way to get detailed feedback about our performance. I remember when I was new I’d get asked why I acted that way during a scene. I’ve also gotten strict advice about things I shouldn’t be doing at a studio. Those happened often back then and I could taste my tears mixed with the beer. (laughs)

**\-- Among those you’ve worked with, is there a drinking performance that impressed you?**

**TR:** Amamiya Sora-chan’s (Ten-chan) performances are definitely one of a kind. While Aqua normally presents herself as the pretty one, she becomes inexplicably lovable once she gets drunk and Ten-chan does a really good job bringing that out in her. Having had drinks with her on days off, she’d just smile all the time and it’s pretty adorable.

**\-- Aside from her performance as Aqua in** **_Konosuba_****, she also did a drinking scene in** **_Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It_****, right?**

**TR:** The way she does that enthusiastic sigh after chugging down a drink is something to behold. Speaking of which, no one really does that in real life, but I’ve had drinks with friends back in my hometown and, to my surprise, they’d just do it. (laughs) I guess that’s one voice acting trope that got out there. (laughs)

**\-- It’s a staple in both anime and manga, but interestingly, you don’t encounter it anywhere else.**

**TR:** But shouting it out feels so great! I’ve even done it myself at home and it really fills you with a sense of satisfaction. So I encourage everyone to try it with _Ichiban Shibori_ and I’m sure it’ll taste all the better!
