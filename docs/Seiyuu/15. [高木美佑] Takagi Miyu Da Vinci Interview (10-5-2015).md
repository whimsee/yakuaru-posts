**\-- How was your photoshoot?**  
  
Takagi Miyu (TM): The weather was unexpectedly cool, even though summer just ended. I haven’t even gone out to buy fall clothes yet!  

**\-- What kind of clothes do you usually wear for this season?**  
  
TM: I decided to go for something feminine and mature for this shoot but all I could find were training jeans and kids’ summer clothes. Usually, I go to stores with a wide selection like Laforet Harajuku and LUMINE in Shinjuku.

**\-- Can you tell us about _Wake Up, Girls! Shadow of Youth (Seishun no Kage)_?**  

TM: It's a continuation of the story about the trials and struggles of the girls from the anime series, _Wake Up, Girls!_ but this time, it's set in Tokyo. I think what’s good about the series and what sets it apart from others is that it presents the characters as relatable people who face challenges and work hard as they aim to accomplish their dreams.  

**\-- How would you describe your character, Okamoto Miyu?**  

TM: She's a happy-go-lucky girl with a radiant smile. In the movie, she has the time of her life as they went around places like Shinjuku. I don't actually think she’s like me at all because I'm more of a reserved, contemplative type, but somehow the other members are convinced that she represents me perfectly. (laughs)  

**\-- How were the recording sessions?**  

TM: It went smoother than before. Maybe it's because of the experience we've gained since debuting or the amount of time we've had representing our characters, I could feel that our understanding of them has deepened. Our seniors Hidaka Noriko (Tange Junko) and Asanuma Shintarou (Matsuda Kouhei) also told us that we've improved. We went out to eat at places shown in the anime and the other day, we discovered that one of them sells gold leaf-decorated raindrop cakes. I thought those were only sold in Yamanashi and they were delicious!

**\-- Having just wrapped up your summer tour, was there a particular show that stood out among the rest?**

TM: I think it would be the warm reception we received in Sendai. Not only did we have one encore performance but two, which was new for us. It was a pleasant surprise and we intend to repay that warmth at our events this coming winter.

**\-- Which member do you get along with the most?**

TM: It would be Aoyama Yoshino. We're the same age and we're both anime otakus as well. (laughs)  

**\-- How about other voice actors?**  

TM: I only know a few. I think it’s more appropriate that I call them role models, but it would be Kato (Katou Emiri) and Fuku (Fukuhara Kaori), who I've worked with in the WUG anime series. The two have always supported me during our radio shows. There’s also Azuki Ryouka from _Hackadoll_. She has a powerful voice for someone so small.  

**\-- Speaking of _Hackadoll_, the anime adaptation just started broadcasting this month. Can you tell us about _Hackadoll_.**

TM: _Hackadoll_ is a news application where personal entertainment AIs named Hackadoll #1, #2 and #3 relay the news to users. Not only does it aggregate general news but also news that caters to anime otaku culture, so I personally find it useful. (laughs) It even has a convenient watchlist so you can keep track of your personal favorites and news related to them.

**\-- How about the anime?**  

TM: The anime is a series of 10-minute shorts where the Hackadolls get caught up into all sorts of comedy gags as they go about their business.  

**\-- Okamoto Miyu and Hackadoll #1 both seem to be similarly cheerful characters. I imagine voicing these characters would be a cinch for you.**

TM: It kind of does but I had to tone it down a bit for Hackadoll #1 since she's supposed to be a homely child-like character, which makes it a better fit for the app.

**\-- Looking at your blog and the way you speak about events like Comiket, you sound like a huge otaku.**

TM: It all started in middle school when I discovered Touhou. _Touhou 12: Unidentified Fantastic Object_ just came out at the time and I got attached to a character named Izayoi Sakuya. I think Minami also discovered Touhou at around the same time. (laughs)  

**\-- And now you got to attend Comiket as part of Hackadoll.**

TM: That was a surprise. Thankfully, I still got to buy what I wanted but I couldn't get Nitroplus merch this time. Their booth always has a two-hour-long line that spills outside the venue, and I would spend the time playing a game with a towel hung over me.  

**\-- This might not be a good question to ask but how much did you spend?**

TM: I spent about 20,000 yen. I've been meaning to save up money lately so I was picky on my purchases.  

![高木美佑](/images/takagi_006.jpg)

**\-- What are your favorite anime or games?**  

TM: Back in middle school, I watched about 10 shows a week and spent my nights locked up in my room playing Touhou. Speaking of games, I'm into a lot of genres especially action and visual novels. I've played a few otome games, too. My favorites are _Little Busters!_, _Higurashi When They Cry (Higurashi no naku koro ni)_ and the _Fate_ series.  

\[Miyu became so absorbed into anime and games during that time that she ended up dropping classical ballet, something that she's been doing since she was 3, then eventually took up track and field because she was becoming lazy and gained weight and needed the motivation to become more physically fit before auditioning for WUG.\]  

**\-- How do you play the protagonist in Otome games?**

TM: Answering that... is kinda embarrassing. (laughs) I get so indecisive when it comes to guys approaching me, unlike with male-focused games where I know straight away who to go for. I get to voice an original character in _Sword Art Online LOST SONG_ (Rain) so I'm actually glad about the prospect that Kirito might romance her. (laughs)

**\-- What made you interested in becoming a voice actress?**

TM: I'm the kind of person who gets influenced easily. Watching _K-ON!_ made me buy a guitar and _Saki_ got me interested in Mahjong. So when I heard my friends say that being a voice actor is cool, it somewhat started my desire to become one. Then afterward, I passed the audition for WUG. I honestly didn't expect to be selected but I'm very glad that I took it seriously.

\[Miyu applied for the 1st Avex x 81 Produce audition, which was for i☆Ris. She got as far as the second (final) screening but saw the gap in skill and motivation between her and the other candidates, which ultimately left her feeling frustrated. But she took that experience as motivation to improve for the next one, which was for WUG.\]

**\-- How does it feel to be an actual voice actress?**  

TM: I learned first-hand that voice actors can do a variety of things. Not only do they act, they also sing and dance, do radio shows and live streams. I love listening to Touhou arranged remixes and hearing that people actually want to make Bad Apple!! remixes of Hackadoll blows my mind. It really is like a dream come true.  

**\-- Who is your role model?**

TM: I guess it's Tamura Yukari. She's a wonderful actress and singer, and I aim to be someone as eternally cute as her.  

**\-- Finally, what kind of voice actress do you want to become?**  

TM: Right now, I'm giving my all into doing many things and I hope that my efforts land me more opportunities in games and anime. As someone who became one thanks to anime, I want to become someone who can inspire others to do the same.

**\-- Thank you for joining me for this interview!**
