**\-- What was going through your mind during the runup to** **_Wake Up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom_****'s theatrical release?**  

Yamashita Nanami (YN): I wanted everyone to know that this is finally Hisami Nanami's time to “Wake up”! The movie explores Nanami-chan's personal circumstances and how she comes to terms with it. I feel a little anxious how viewers will see her after this but I hope to hear they think.  

**\-- Can you give a quick refresher about Hisami Nanami and how she changed over the course of the series?**  

YN: Up until now, she's been a self-centered girl who wants to achieve everything on her own. Because of that, she hasn't connected with the other girls and she never really contributes whenever they deliberate.  
  
Throughout the sequel movies, however, she learns how to empathize with others, and even matures a little along the way. But at her core, she's still just as earnest and honest about herself and her dreams.  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-01.jpg)

**\-- Like the fact that she loves the Hikarizuka Revue and how she aspires to be part of it?**  

YN: Exactly! She's really taken in by how cool the female roles are in their shows. And of course, a part of it is also because her parents want to see her perform in it.  

**\-- Have you seen a show by the real-life entity it's referencing, the Takarazuka Revue?**  

YN: I haven't but I did ballet for a long time so I've seen a lot of classic ballet shows.  

**\-- How long did you do classic ballet?**  

YN: I started at 3 until I was 15 years old. That makes it 12 years... which is a long time. (laughs) When I was new, I used to run barefoot around the stage, dreaming that someday when I grow up I'll be on it performing as the lead of _Giselle_. But I eventually stopped due to the demands of high school entrance exams.  

**\-- Did all that classic ballet and stage experience benefit in the way you approach Wake Up, Girls! activities?**  

YN: I believe it does. It gives me confidence on stage. (laughs) I get so nervous at first but also I understand that it's natural, and I think I have my ballet and stage experience to thank for that.  

**\-- So in a sense, you figured out how to associate dealing with nerves with ballet?**  

YN: Right. My ballet instructor at the time taught me that even messing up is part of dance, and it remember it to this day. So even now if I make mistakes, I don't get affected by it. It just feels right to me.  

**\-- Which show have you felt the most nervous?**  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-02.jpg)

YN: There are lots but let me think of a good one! It has to be the showcase event at the beginning of the year (2015 Solo Event) because it's the first time I performed a full show on my own. I sang K-On!'s _Fuwa Fuwa Time_ and I was already so nervous that I ended up forgetting the lyrics. There's also Anisama (Animelo Summer Live), which was probably just as nerve-racking, but the showcase event was my first time doing something like that so it really stuck out for me.  

**\-- How about lately especially that you've had more opportunities to sing solo with your character song,** **_Ookami to Piano_****?**  

YN: That was during this tour's character song medley, right? I felt completely fine during those. There's a flow that I fall into once I change outfits where I just get into the proper frame of mind and I feel in control of myself.  

**\-- You look completely at ease on stage, like you have the whole audience on the palm of your hand as they go crazy for you.**  

YN: They go crazy? (laughs) I think it's because of the tour. We have a lot of new songs to show, which can get pretty tough and hectic, that we just live in the moment, song after song, so we don't even have the energy to feel nervous.  

**\-- I also think this was due to everything you went through last year.**  

YN: I completely agree! This definitely wouldn't be possible if it weren't for my experiences in the last tour.

\[Their first year as a unit was tough for them physically, especially when they perform 7 Girls War, which always left them out of breath due to the constantly intense nature of the choreography and Nanami herself felt she had the least stamina out of everyone along with Minami.\]

**\-- Let's move on to the dubbing sessions for the sequel movies. How did go for _Beyond the Bottom_****?**  

YN: I got to work with Marinka (Kouno Marika), who voices a character from the unit Next Storm!  

**\-- You worked with her for** **_Ohenro_****, if I recall correctly.**  

YN: Yes! We met in the studio and I was glad because we get to work together on another project aside from Ohenro. When it was over, she complimented me on my performance, and hearing that from her made me happy.  

**\-- I've heard the same thing from everyone that you've improved.**  

YN: Thank you. I have to get better, even if a little!  

**\-- Have you felt any improvement yourself?**  

YN: A little bit. I still feel the nerves but the change I made for myself is that once I get in front of the mic, I straighten my posture and place the script on my eye level before I start reading lines. Before, I used to look down on the script as if I'm reading from a textbook but I always end up not getting to deliver my lines well and I often mess up the timing.  
  
That's how we've always been taught, but I haven't truly applied it until then. The proper and natural way to do it is to place the script at eye level so it sits between your line of sight and the screen, so you have a view of both as you act out lines. Once I started to doing that, I've improved in a lot of ways.  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-03.jpg)

**\-- Which scene from the movie stuck out with you?**  

YN: This might be unexpected but it's the scene where we clean the WUG Wagon. Everyone looked so adorable and we were asked to ad-lib and say just about anything we want in shots where the characters are off-camera, which lead to Yoppi having lines like "Stop stepping on the hose!". It was fun!  

**\-- Were there any standout performances from your seniors?**  

YN: I feel like I'm improved in that regard since I gained a different perspective on acting. I've become able to take in more and learn different ideas from watching them perform compared from before.

**\-- Like what?**  

YN: There's a scene where Ōtsubo (Yuka)-san character, Shihocchi, tells Mayu that she'll message her about a good tonkotsu ramen place. I learned by watching her perform that there's a distinct difference in breathing and delivery when your character’s back is turned toward someone.  

**\-- With all the rival idol groups featured in this movie such as Next Storm and Oga Namahagees, which left the deepest impression on you?**  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-05.jpg)

YN: Next Storm especially those naughty outfits I heard they're wearing. I'm so jealous. I want to try them on!  

**\-- It looks great on Kouno-san!**  

YN: You're absolutely right! I heard about it from her during Machiasobi. I can already imagine it looking great on her, so I can't wait to see it! I'm so jealous.  

**\-- Why don't you?**  

YN: I want to! But that outfit isn't something WUG would wear. (laughs) I want to wear it for _Ookami to Piano_.  

**\-- That would be perfect!**  

YN: Isn’t it?! (laughs)  

**\-- I'm looking forward to seeing it though I think Nanami-chan, being the youngest, might get intimidated by that. Next Storm's new members are all 13 years old and I-1's new center, Suzuki Moka, is just as young.**  

YN: I really like Moka. She never lets anything get in her way and that makes her more adorable. I think the position of center is perfect for her and while Nanami-chan also hopes to reach that level, she is not as skilled as Moka. That said, Nanami-chan has her own unique aspects that make her great. But as someone she aspires to be, Moka-chan has my support.  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-06.jpg)

**\-- Now let's move on to another topic. Particularly, your acting. Did these new revelations about Nanami-chan affect how you portray her in any significant way?**  

YN: It definitely did! She didn't have quite as many long lines in the TV series compared to the movies. This was my first time tackling them as her, so I was pretty nervous before we started recording. (laughs)  

**\-- How about her emotional scenes like the one where she cried? How did they go?**  

YN: I pulled it off! I haven't done something that intense before... getting into the moment and fully understanding Nanami-chan's feelings. So I just went in and faced it head-on without having any plan or idea in mind.  

**\-- This kind of reminds me of how the other members faced their own challenges.**  

YN: Yes. It reminded me especially of them. There's the airport scene, where it showed flashbacks involving the others. It reminded me of the times I've spent with the actual members and through that I was easily able to empathize with her and what she was going through right at that moment.  

**\-- What kind of advice did Director Yamamoto give?**  

YN: He told me to cry in a way a child would—unreserved and full of innocence. Nanami-chan is the youngest and she's been bottling up all these thoughts and emotions inside her and she finally cries to release them.  

**\-- How about during and after that scene? Did he say anything?**  

YN: He only gave me that one suggestion.  

**\-- Does that mean he thought you pulled it off perfectly?**  

YN: Not in the slightest! (laughs) He's just not the type to do things like that.  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-07.jpg)

**\-- Didn't he say during the production of the TV series that if you can't pull off a convincing crying performance, he'd rather cry instead?**  

YN: It was terrifying. (laughs)  

**\-- I think it's impressive, though. You can get into character and pull that off easily now just by thinking about your friends.**  

YN: You think so? I’m not sure….  

**\-- I think Director Yamamoto's just holding back on your account. What kind of comments does he usually give, if I may ask? (laughs)**  

YN: He's not the type to give praise. He didn't really comment much when we recorded for the TV series, even when I was messing up. It was like he has his mind on other things at the time.  

**\-- If you were to put on your director's hat for a moment, what would you look for in a scene like that?**  

YN: I was fortunate to have watched experienced voice actors perform scenes like that numerous times inside the booth before I got to do it myself. It’s important to understand that, first and foremost, you shouldn’t feel embarrassed.     
  
When I watched Saori Hayami-san act out a crying scene for _When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace (Inō-Batoru wa Nichijō-kei no Naka de_), it was amazing that she could even shed tears like that while performing inside the studio. That why I think you shouldn’t feel self-conscious that people are going to watch you cry.  

**\-- I think it's great that you're able to draw and learn from your experiences from other projects and apply them back to WUG.**  

YN: I think so, too! I hope I can at least pull off a tear-jerking performance the same way Hayami-san does it.  

**\-- Having those experiences really brings life into one's performances. On that note, has there been a piece of music that broadened your perspective on singing?**  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-08.jpg)

YN: During _Sugao de KISS ME_'s recording, Hirokawa-san (the song's composer) asked us to sing like a sexy lolita. He must have been imagining Nanami-chan as he suggested it. When I heard the final version, I felt conscious that our characters are going to be portrayed quite differently from who they were so far, and I wondered how we could translate that into our stage performance.  

**\-- That sounds very forward coming from Hirokawa-san. It must have been a little amusing to hear that from someone with a reserved persona such as him.**  

YN: It completely caught me off guard. (laughs) I honestly didn't expect him to say that. The choreography is also a little seductive so it matches quite well with the song when we perform it live. I was especially good at the dainty moves.  

**\-- The precise sharpness of the movements is quite dynamic and expressive.**  

YN: I definitely thank my ballet experience that I was able to move so well in different ways. It’s because of that this song is one of my favorites.  

**\-- What drove you to audition for WUG and were you able to realize the goals you've set for yourself going into it?**  

YN: I auditioned initially because I wanted to be a vocalist. So when we started taking acting lessons, I really disliked doing them. It’s not because I hated it, but because I couldn't wrap my head around it at all. I ended up feeling so frustrated that I cried during one of the sessions. It was then that our instructor approached me and told me that learning how to express one’s emotions is important, even in singing. She advised me to try to approach acting that way.  
  
Since then I started to take it seriously, and now all my efforts are starting to pay off in WUG activities, other projects, and live performances. So I think was able to reach my goal but I still have a long way to go.

\[In her self-introduction in All Night Nippon Mobile, she said that she used to be part of a girls band in Tokushima as a vocalist and guitarist, joking that she's bad at the guitar and would often just mime the motions.\]

**\-- I think it's great that your instructor was able to motivate you that way.**  

YN: She's wonderful! Whenever I cry, she hands me a cup of Häagen-Dazs. So even now, whenever I feel frustrated, I crave for it.  

**\-- What an interesting anecdote!**  

YN: Hehehe. It's kind of a secret. (laughs) Even now she sends me a message whenever she sees me on TV. She's a great teacher and she told me I was her first student who moved her to tears.  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-10.jpg)

**\-- Didn't you also audition because you looked up to AAA (Avex Pop group) as a singer? Even now, do you still aspire to be a singer who represents herself?**  

YN: That hasn't changed! I still love to sing, after all. But I also love to sing as Nanami-chan, imagining how she would do it. Either way is good for me.  

**\-- What's your personal favorite song?**  

YN: I'm a huge fan of aiko-san (Aiko Yanai). I always sing her songs whenever I do karaoke.  

**\-- Hopefully, I get to see you perform as yourself.**  

YN: Someday. (laughs) I hope it happens someday.  

**\-- At the time of this interview, I-1 club is currently leading 3-2 in _Kaettekita Fureai Project_ (A promotional event for Festa 2015) and the only way to turn that around is for you and Takagi Miyu-san to win against Fukuhara Kaori and Yasuno Kiyono, respectively.**  

YN: We definitely have our work cut out for us! (laughs) We also lost last year so I'm not confident that we'll win, but we'll persevere for our fans! Miyu's first so I'll cheer for her... though that might just put more pressure on her, so maybe not. (laughs) In any case, I'll do my best for my match!  

![](/images/sp-1512182200-11.jpg)

**\-- How well do you know Fukuhara-san as an opponent?**  

YN: I don't have a good read on her, which puts me at a disadvantage. Kato-san's very pleasant, energetic, and straightforward. I've worked with Fukuhara-san for radio shows and I feel she has a more laid back and relaxed vibe. So maybe if I put all my effort into it and take it completely seriously, I might just win.

**\-- I don't think she's just like that, though.**  

YN: I know and that's why I'm scared to face her. (laughs) But I think neither of us has an advantage over the other so I think this will be a good match!  

(\*\* Both Takagi-san and Yamashita-san won against their respective opponents and as a result, WUG gets to release their character songs.)  

**\-- Finally, let's close this off with a word about the sequel movies and your hopes for WUG moving forward.**  

YN: I'm sure there are fans out there who have been wondering when Nanami-chan will finally "Wake up". Look forward to _Beyond the Bottom_, where she comes to terms with her feelings and see her mature. After this, I may start expressing more of her feminine side, but I also hope to retain the charm that she always has. I've gotten to appreciate her more and more and hopefully, I get to show these shades of affection to everyone!
