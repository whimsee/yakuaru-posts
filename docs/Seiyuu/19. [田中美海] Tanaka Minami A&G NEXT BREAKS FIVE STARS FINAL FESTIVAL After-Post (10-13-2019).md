**「A&G NEXT BREAKS FIVE STARS FINAL FESTIVAL」**

For all who came to see us,  
who watched the live stream,  
and those who have supported us…  
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart!

Thank you to the staff as well, who worked so hard to make the show happen in spite of the circumstances! We also wish things could be better, but I'm glad we did a live stream to show our new song to more people.

I thought was gonna write so many things here but I guess I've said it all already on my final show. 😊

No words can express my gratitude for everyone who chose to tune in to FIVE STARS and watch me out of all the shows out there each and every week. ✨✨✨

To be honest, it seemed fine in the end but I did have so much fun talking during the event that I lost track of time. The live portion went by so quick I didn't realize we were singing our final song… 😢 I haven't even warmed up yet so I was feeling a little restless as I shared the stage with the other girls!!

To Tomoyo-chan, who was the most composed in spite of being the youngest  
Seria-chan, our leader who cried like there was no tomorrow  
Rissan, our lovable goof who has a way with words  
Yuuri-chan, who was always there to look out for us

The outfits we wore were just like the program we built together with the staff for four and a half years—united as one yet it makes our individual qualities shine through. ✨  
We have such a powerful vibe when we're together. I felt it during our reading drama and I felt it again during our live portion. That energy built itself over the years, and it was so strong there that I couldn't help but cry at the end. 😂💦  
I'm so glad we got to work together. 🥰🥰

It was so enjoyable going to the radio station every Wednesday to talk about my hobbies, where I smile and laugh, then cry and laugh again. 😊 It was nerve-racking at first and there were times where I worried over what to say or if I was able to convey it properly. It's a miracle I got to do this for so long and it's all thanks to the staff for being so wonderful and supportive! You're the best! 😊😊😊✨

My slot was also on Wednesdays, smack dab in the middle of the week. It's a tough spot and I'm always in awe at the amount of messages and letters I get from people who enjoy my show because all I do is laugh and have fun responding to emails and talk about what's going on with me! It made me realize how much of an effect it had with all sorts of people, which is pretty awesome. 😊

And I think everyone wins here because through FS, I learned about my viewers who follow WUG or know about Fate or King of Prism ✨✨, which also made my day as well. 😃💫✌️

This is getting a little long. lol  
Hmmm….. There's so much I want to write but let me at least end with this!!  
Pouring your support to someone is the absolute best thing in the world!!!

It could be just listening to their radio shows, no matter the subject, during your commute.  
It could be sharing those moments laughing and crying with them.  
It could be going to events, or through sending presents, letters, or flowers.  
I've said it already on my final show but it's worth repeating -- All of it truly means a lot. ✨✨✨  
I'll move forward carrying those feelings close to my heart.  
I didn't realize how much I've taken it for granted.  
Thank you FIVE STARS for reminding me. ✨

Thank you so much for all the love you've given to FIVE STARS. Wednesday will forever be a special day to me and I've gained another treasure to cherish. 💫✨✨  
  
I love FIVE STARS!
