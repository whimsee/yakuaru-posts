**My interests have always stayed the same ever since I was a kid**

* * *

**\-- Congratulations on becoming an official adult!**

**Yamazaki Erii (YE):** Thank you!

**\-- Since you’ve already had your 20th birthday last year, did it feel strange celebrating your coming of age only recently?**

**YE:** I actually feel more like my age now than when I had my birthday. I wouldn’t call it life-changing but getting to wear a long-sleeved kimono and visiting a shrine is what you do when you’re 20.

**\-- And right now, we’re here to talk about your life thus far.**

**YE:** I’m ready for it! (laughs)

**\-- What kind of kid were you during your childhood?**

**YE:** I was quite shy. I always hid behind my mom, clutching tightly on her skirt. I rarely spoke, just saying “yes” all the time; like if someone asked me if I wanted an apple, I’d automatically say yes. I don’t necessarily dislike talking to people but I had my own little world, and I really just started playing with friends in kindergarten, where I loved being on the swing. (laughs)

**\-- I’d like to know more about that, if you don’t mind.**

**YE:** We had a swing set in our kindergarten. We could play with it until it’s time to go home, though I’d be the only one who stays on it since my friends would only join me for a bit before moving on to other things like the slide. I only played with the swings so my mom was always there to push me. (laughs)

I slowly came to enjoy playing outside because I loved the swings so much. Before that, I played with dolls and I adored the Disney Princesses. I watched their shows all the time so I wore dresses and acted like a princess at home.

**\-- Those childhood dreams and aspirations feel poetic now, given your work.**

**YE:** It does. I used to stand at the top of the stairs, wearing my dress, and sing at the top of my lungs. I imagined it as my own stage. My voice would echo like it would in an opera house, which was really fun.

**\-- When did you start thinking of performing in front of an audience?**

**YE:** I’ve always enjoyed singing for as far as I remember. I loved Disney songs. I’m a fan of Matsuda Seiko and I enjoyed idol songs as well.

**\-- So you never grew out of it, then.**

**YE:** I pretty much managed to stay the same from my childhood all the way up to now. (laughs) I stuck to my interests back then that even in middle school, a time where kids start getting into what’s trendy, I just stayed where I was.

**\-- That’s around the time you entered the** **_Horipro Talent Scout Caravan_****.**

**YE:** I was 13, in my second year of middle school. I’d never once spoken in front of a crowd back then, so I tried doing class duties. (laughs) It was nerve-racking in a class of 30 or so, but I did it because I really wanted to be a performer and, as luck would have it, the Scout Caravan was happening and my mom encouraged me to apply.

**\-- Do you have any anecdotes from the Scout Caravan audition?**

**YE:** I was convinced I wasn’t going to pass since there were a lot of people in the preliminary screening. And in order to trim that number down to 30, you only had 20 seconds to show the panel who you are. I sang _Honey_ from _Card Captor Sakura_ and my time was up before I even reached the chorus.

**\-- Why were you sure that you failed?**

**YE:** I went in there and said my name, entry number, age, and my talent but I never got to the good part as I started singing. I thought that was it for me so I readied my stuff and waited for the results. Then they started calling out entry numbers. Mine wouldn’t possibly come up, I thought, so I was going to leave until someone stopped me because my number was actually mentioned.

**\-- So if that staff member didn’t know it was you…**

**YE:** That would have been it and I wouldn’t have known. The intense training camps came next. I was surprised to have classmates who, like me, have never stayed out overnight. We’ve only just met and our ages were all over the place and we’re all staying in the same place, doing lessons day and night, learning how to act, walk, dance, sing, and more. It was tough but I enjoyed it. Then we did another camp in Tokyo and that was it for the Scout Caravan. I didn’t get the Grand Prix but I was approached by another contact that led me to do voice acting work.

**I want to take in wonderful things to draw out new sides of myself**

* * *

**\-- Was there anything you worked on since your voice acting debut that made it click for you?**

**YE:** My personal turning point would have to be the first anime I was a regular cast of, _Samurai Flamenco_. I probably owe where I am right now to it. I felt a lot of pressure since being a regular was new to me and the show ran for 22 episodes. At the time, I’d only just finished my acting lessons so I knew all too well how inadequate my skills were, not to mention the nerves I felt just being with fellow cast members. Even getting in front of the mic was a struggle. But I persevered, all the while learning what I can about myself through it.

**\-- Now that you’re more experienced, would you say that your approach to voice acting has changed?**

**YE:** I guess several things changed. Recently, I voiced the Materia Sisters in _Frame Arms Girl_, and I found it difficult to portray seductively playful roles because I couldn’t relate to mysterious characters like them. I’ve gotten more conscious of narration when I watch TV shows. I’ve also started dissecting how someone could deliver their lines in such a manner and if I could do that myself. I’ve also considered other ideas such as relying less on my natural voice and experimenting with my upper and lower register, and having a singing career alongside my voice acting work.

**\-- So you also thought of using your voice to sing.**

**YE:** I’ve always thought that singing is fun, but I’ve been considering how to sing in such a way that conveys your thoughts to people. And if it’s a live concert, how you would get them to smile.

If we’re being technical, my voice tends to vibrato so I’m figuring out ways to control it. When we do song recordings, I’ve started becoming aware of how my voice suits or clashes with a particular song, so I experiment with different techniques.

**\-- There must be a lot of techniques out there, so what do you want to try?** 

**YE:** I’m not sure... though when I sang the Materia Sisters’ character song for _Frame Arms Girl_, I had a lot of fun drawing out that playful mood. What’s funny is that it was a mix of two voices—one higher, the other deeper—but they’re both sung by me, which was a neat dichotomy of having different versions of myself in a song. I managed to do that, so trying other styles would be great as well.

**\-- What kind of voice actress do you want to be?**

**YE:** I intend to stick to my course while broadening my horizons. I also want to figure out how to relate my interests and curiosities to my work. Whenever I watch musicals and such, I also take in things that I find neat and clever. Then I incorporate those ideas so I can create new versions of myself to draw out.

**\-- In that case, what’s piquing your curiosity lately?**

**YE:** I’ve always been a Disney fan but I’d like to experience cosplaying the characters I’ve portrayed. I’ve worn costumes before but not a full makeover, complete with a wig.

**\-- I’m sure all of us would like to see that. (laughs)**

**YE:** Oh, no… I’d feel terrible since I wouldn’t be giving justice to the character at all…

I’d also like to try cutting my hair short since I’ve always worn my hair long. I’d probably look like a completely different person.

**\-- You’re 20 years young. Still a lot of things in store for you.**

**YE:** I’m not one to voice out my desires, but I’m feeling cheeky and if you were to ask my thoughts for the future, I’d say I want to be someone who’s out there and confident in what they want to do. It’s what I’m aiming for!

**\-- Finally, can you tell us your personal goal?**

**YE:** I want to be fully independent. I’m pretty hopeless when there’s no one I can rely on… For instance, if I have to go to the studio on short notice, I’d have my mom go there with me. (laughs) And when I have 2 to 3 hours to myself between jobs, I get so anxious about being late that I would just pick a bench in a park and sit there the entire time. I could never while away those hours all by myself in a fancy cafe. I’d just be a bundle of nerves, sipping tea while agonizing over what’ll happen if I do come late. So I hope to be more carefree and confident in myself. (laughs)

**Trivia Questions**

**Q: What are your nicknames?**

**A:** My nickname, Erii, is tough to draw other names from, so people often add _\-chan_ to it, especially when I was starting out. Sometimes I get called “Zaki-san”, which doesn’t register immediately to me. (laughs). “Mari-chan”, a unique shorthand of my name, is another because I like Marie from Disney \[The Aristocats\].

**Q: What special moments make you happy?**

**A:**  Chatting with my family. It’s an atmosphere so cozy that I rarely even go to my room when I visit home. My room is just there for me to sleep in but otherwise, I’d be out in the living room chatting with someone. We rarely fight; the closest was an argument with my brother over watching Formula One racing or _Doraemon_ on the TV.

**Q: Are you friends with any actors?**

**A:** Tomoe Kei and Koichi Makoto, who were my fellow members in our unit for _Nurse Witch Komugi_. We still get together and hang out at cafes or at Disneyland. I love the calming vibes I get from them, with their personality and the things they know. One time we had a crazy idea of going to Disneyland that day before heading to a studio to shoot a live show and all the while we were just happily chatting along.

**Q: What’s your filler phrase?**

**A:** Hmm, I dunno… huh, now _that’s_ a phrase I often say. (laughs) I tend to blurt it out when there’s dead air and I get anxious. My stylist had a peculiar way of saying “excuse me” so there was a time when I mimicked that as well.

\[For those curious, the filler phrase she mentioned is “何だろう。。。？”, which could be translated any number of ways contextually; here, I used “I dunno”. And the other is “ごめんなすって”, a light and somewhat quaint apology akin to saying “excuse me/passing through...” rather than “I’m sorry”. It apparently shows up often in period plays.\]

**Three Favorite Things**  
  
**1\. Disney** - It will always be my #1!!!  
  
**2\. Tuna** \- I love Tuna so much I always get it at sushi places. Just recently, our team went out together to eat and to my surprise, they brought me to a tuna place and I was in heaven. (laughs)  
  
**3\. Marie Antoinette** - I was fascinated by her after reading a biography written about her and seeing what she looked like in a museum. As I got older, I eventually started looking more into her. Someday I want to follow the traces of her life, from her beginnings in Austria all the way to France.
