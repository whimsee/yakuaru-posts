**\-- Let’s start this off by asking about Shimada Mayu. What kind of character is she to you now?**  

Yoshioka Mayu (YM): She's someone I admire. I've written a lot of shadow narrations \[The scripted reading portions before each event and live show where the girls act as their respective characters\] involving all the girls and I write them from Shimada Mayu's perspective. They've gotten much closer compared from before and as a result, it has gotten easier for me to write dialogue for them.  
  
She adores Hiyoko \[_Hiyoko Honpo Yoshinodo_, the small yellow chicks\] and loves her mother and grandmother dearly. She gets deeply passionate but she's a kind person at heart. She used to be the center of I-1 Club's top group and is now part of Wake Up, Girls! and if I were in her shoes at the time, I'm not sure if I could manage to be as kind as her and keep in touch with her old groupmates. But it's clear that she cares about them a lot because she's still close friends with Yoshimegu (Yoshikawa Megumi) and Serika-chan (Kurowara Serika, Introduced in S1 EP 9's flashback)  
  
She places great value in people and the things she loves, and that quality of hers is something I strive to learn from every day.

**\-- So she's someone you look up to. Has she directly influenced you in some way?**  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c001.jpg)

YM: It's her love of Hiyoko, definitely. I've begun to collect Hiyoko merchandise. The pen case I bring with me is Hiyoko. The makeup pouch I carry with me is Hiyoko. My wall at home is filled with Hiyoko stuff like straps and other items. I feel like my room is slowly getting overrun by its yellow hue. (laughs)  
  
On the other hand, I have influenced her in some way as well, mostly in her depiction in _Wake Up, Girls! ZOO!_ where she's a completely different character as Lion Mayu. But even now, coming from her introduction in _7 Idols_ (_Shichinin no Idol_), she's undergone a change. She initially came across as a strong-willed girl with a kind heart, but some might wonder why she'd become more melancholic lately. I think I had something to do with it. (laughs) When Director Yamamoto looked over the scripts, he noticed that there were aspects to her that may have changed because of me, which is something to take note of for the sequel movies.  

**\-- Since the recording for _Shadow of Youth_ (_Seishun no Kage_) just wrapped up, how does it feel to work on a WUG project again after all this time?**  

YM: There was an amicable feeling of tension in the studio. It had been a while since but the awkward air from back then was gone. The core ideas of our characters hadn't changed so we easily slipped into character once we stood in front of the mic. Also, we’ve stopped feeling nervous talking with our senior veterans, Hidaka Noriko-san and Asanuma Shintarō-san (voicing Tange and Matsuda, respectively).  

**\-- Did Director Yamamoto give any kind of feedback?**  

YM: His direction is as strict as always. What stood out to me was when he told us to make sure that our dialogue between us members don’t sound forced as if we’re acting. He would often bring that up especially for one-on-one conversations. He even said at one point, "What kind of friends would all of you be if your conversations don’t sound a little awkward." (laughs)  

**\-- Are you all close to each other, then?**  

YM: Of course we are! (laughs)  

**\-- Since this was for the movie, the time it took to record the lines should have taken longer compared to a regular TV series.**  

YM: We divided the recording time across two days. We did most of it during the first day, then the rest in the following day.  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c002.jpg)

**\-- How have you been doing especially recently that you're juggling work and studies?**  

YM: I feel like I’m slowly broadening my horizons with the new developments related to WUG and, at the same time, new roles I've been getting as an actress, in general. I’m also in my second year in college and there's a lot more I need to study, which means spending more time in front of the desk. It feels pretty overwhelming because it’s the middle of test season and some of them might hit right on a day of a live event. (laughs) I even have exams during the weekends.

\[The members and even Mayu herself would often joke how she's practically attached to her Apple laptop wherever she goes. Eventually, she bought a Microsoft Surface, which she originally bought for her brother but ended up getting one herself, to use on-the-go.\]

**\-- You seem to be very enthusiastic with theater lately since you’ve been starring in SOLID STAR productions such as** **_You be Cool!_** **and** **_Heaven Eleven!!._**  

YM: I got to play as a ridiculous girl who says strange things in _Heaven Eleven!!_. Having that role was a new and fun experience for me.  

**\-- Since you have prior theater experience before you auditioned through the Lucky Star Stage play, did your experience being in WUG as Shimada Mayu affect how you approach theater acting?**  

YM: It’s interesting since I feel that both of them are linked to each other. A lot of things changed in how I portrayed Mayu-chan over time. For one, she started smiling more in front of others and you'll get to see that side of her in the sequel movies. I owe much of my experience as Mayu-chan to theater, but there are also times when I get to bring forth that experience for my other roles.

\[She mentioned in a video show that Miyano Mamoru originally got her interested in acting. She first knew of him as a theater actor but later surprised to find out that he's a multi-talented voice actor, which spurred her interest in becoming like that as well.\]

**\-- Isn’t that what WUG is all about? Growing with the character?**  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c003.jpg)

YM: True. That’s why, out of everything, WUG has the most personal attachment to me.  

**\-- WUG seems to be set to make a huge impact this year with the 2nd live tour, Anisama (Animelo Summer Live 2015), and the release of the sequel movies.**  

YM: I’m actually having trouble keeping up with it all. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve heard the announcement before. There have been a lot of times where we get told that we’re going to do this and that in the middle of rehearsal and that would be the first time we’d hear it. Now that we have more solo activities, we have to discuss how they coincide with our respective schedules, so it feels quite difficult to take everything in.  

**\-- I can kind of imagine a regular occurrence of you doing your own thing then "Surprise announcement!" out of nowhere.**  

YM: Right. It's hard to let the feeling sink in when it happens like that, so we just get swept up in the flow of things. That's why I mentioned that some events might end up falling on an exam day. (laughs) But I feel that it's those times that I need to step up my game.  

**\-- We're taking this interview right before the 2nd Live Tour begins in Osaka, so I want to ask you about Wonder Festival (WonderFes). This year, you're one of the featured performers opening for the event.**  

YM: That came as a surprise! I'm not even sure if we deserve it. Our senior unit, i☆Ris , is also performing on the same day as the main act for Puripara and I'm looking forward to watching them. But I'm also a fan of Idolmaster songs. I actually auditioned for WUG with _READY!!_ so I want to see them on stage as well. But before all that, we'll make a good impression as the opening act.

\[She mentioned in Hara Yumi's Niconico show ○○放送局 大盛 that she picked _READY!!_ as her one-chorus acapella song because she noticed that Kousaki Satoru (who eventually became Tachiagare's composer) was in the room and searched for a song he composed to make a good impression.\]

**\-- Do you still remember how it was when WUG was first introduced in WonderFes two years ago?**  

YM: Of course! I still have very vivid memories of the backstage instead of the actual show. I was with the members, Director Yamamoto, Machida Touko-san (Scriptwriter), and Kōsaki Satoru-san (_Tachiagare_'s Composer). Katō Emiri-san was also there to cheer us on. I remember Director Yamamoto telling us that he's probably more nervous that we are so we'll be fine. (laughs) Machida-san was close to tears while Katou-san was there as emotional support. We were unbelievably nervous. I look back at our performance that day feeling relieved. We weren't great but we weren't bad either. We weren't satisfied and we felt that there was still room for improvement.  

**\-- And two years later, you find yourselves on the same stage. I'm sure there are people out there hoping to see how much you've improved since then.**  

YM: We'll do our best! (laughs) We should have premiered our new song _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_ (SKKK) in Osaka by then, and hopefully, that would bring us to bigger stages. I'm sure there will be people who haven't been to our tour shows, or know about us at all so this would be a good chance for them to see us. Even if it is just to get our name out there as _Wake Up, Girls!_, it will make me happy that people will get to know who we are and even get interested in us.  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c04.jpg)

**\-- Let's go back a bit to before your debut. What were your goals and aspirations when you auditioned for WUG?**  

YM: I simply wanted to become a voice actress.  

**\-- So you came in just like that?**  

YM: My dream since I was little was to get into the entertainment industry so I tried pursuing it by various means. There were steep hurdles everywhere but that only got me more motivated as I challenged myself doing things that I haven't done before. I even auditioned as an idol at some point \[for NMB48\]. I was into anime when I heard about the WUG audition, and I learned that those who pass will get to sing and appear in talk shows. But most of all, I also learned how voice actors could act all sorts of roles through the use of their voice alone, which got me interested, so I auditioned.

**\-- So you came in aiming to become a distinguished voice actress. Do you feel like you've achieved that?**  

YM: I still have a long way to go. This might sound arrogant but I originally came in wanting that each and every anime fan out there will know about me, Yoshioka Mayu. I want them to recognize me as a voice actress. It makes me happy that I’m getting more chances to work and show different sides of myself. I think this urge came about because I always wanted to be a performer. And now I want to extend that with WUG as “Yoshioka Mayu from Wake Up, Girls!”.  

**\-- It sounds like you didn’t have that mindset before. Did something in you change?**  

YM: I’m more experienced now compared to when I was little and long before I debuted. The me from back then probably dreamed of this, so I want to tell her as someone approaching the age of twenty, that I did achieve it, just to give her confidence. (laughs) I want to make her proud and believe that it will be possible. Because of my ambition, I became part of WUG and experienced many different things, and I've gained a broader perspective on life.  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c005.jpg)

**\-- Among the events you've done so far, can you tell me a specific incident that stood out for you? Not the event itself but something that happened during the event like during a song, for instance.**  

YM: This happened during my solo with Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) in _7 Girls War_ at _Wake Up, Girls! Festa 2014_. We were on a platform that rose as we sang our parts, and I saw the light sticks crowding the entire hall were turning green, our image color, just like from the anime. It's a sight that I will never forget. I unwittingly grabbed Yoppi's hand and didn't even realize that I did until I watched the blu-ray. I was just so moved by it all. Having Yoppi next to me, keeping me at ease. The other members singing with us. And our fans, so many of them, there to support us... It was a rush unlike any other.

**\-- Now with the 2nd Live Tour about to start, I want to ask about your experience from last year's 1st Live Tour.**  

YM: I wasn't confident that we would even get to do a second tour back then, so I treated it with the utmost attention. We featured a different character song for each venue, and we even had a guest for the Sendai stop. We wanted it to feel that every show was unique, as it was a culmination of all our efforts at the time.  

\[Mayu wrote a comedy skit for the 1st Tour's Osaka stop, which she revisited and rewrote for the Final Tour Part 2's Osaka stop.\]  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c006.jpg)

**\-- I heard that the usually demanding Director Yamamoto praised all of you via email.**  

YM: I'm not even sure if he meant it or if he was just being sarcastic (laughs). Now that I think about it though, maybe he felt just as accomplished as we were, or maybe he felt that he fulfilled one of his goals for us.  

**\-- You didn't expect him to recognize your efforts even if you improved?**  

YM: I think he's an idealist who believes that we can go higher and do better. He doesn't say it and I think that's why he comes off as quite blunt and strict... Lately though it's like he's not being his usual himself. Sometimes, he would get concerned and ask if we're doing well.  

**\-- I would think that he's being sarcastic if he started giving praise and getting worried like that. (laughs) But if I may ask if this is how you feel, isn't the 2nd Tour about showing everyone that "WUG is just getting started"?**  

YM: It's not just in regard to Director Yamamoto, but the rest of the staff as well. I want them to see the kind of live show we want to make! We've yet to discover our limits as a group so when they asked us for ideas and requests in preparation for the tour, we told them that we wanted to be more involved in making it now that we've gained the confidence to try all sorts of ideas.

**\-- How were the rehearsals?**  

YM: We're all feeling excited especially that we're close to showing everyone our new songs. I feel anxious as well since we'll be performing our staples and it has been a while so I'm not sure if my body still remembers what to do. But the biggest change from the first tour is the experience we gained. We understand now how physically demanding it can be so we learned how to manage our stamina, which should be a big help.

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c007.jpg)

**\-- The tour will begin at your hometown, Osaka, right?**  

YM: I wonder why that is... I'd rather have it a little later into the tour. By then, we'd be more used to it, our performances would be more polished, and we'd have more confidence, enough that I'd feel truly excited about performing there. (laughs) Our challenge this tour is trying to find our comfort zone as we try new things.  

**\-- Didn't it also start at Osaka last year? I heard that it was an exhausting first show.**  

YM: It sure was! I think me and Myuu had it worst since both of us did the most songs—our respective character songs, Myuu’s cover of _Taiyouiwakumoeyo Chaos_, and me with _Aa Hikarizuka Kagekidan_.  

**\-- The conditions must have been tough as well. There was a typhoon threatening to hit that day along with record high heat and humidity, not to mention it was your first experience doing a full show.**  

YM: Yeah. I was burning up inside my outfit. (laughs)  

**\-- Now with Osaka prepared for, which song for you is the hardest to perform?**  

YM: Right now... It would definitely be _7 Girls War_.

**\-- I would have thought that song would be a comfortable pick, being a staple song and all...**  

![](/images/sp-1507241200-c008.jpg)

YM: It's a very difficult song to pull off overall because having to sing and dance on a tempo that fast right at the start can be exhausting.  

**\-- It takes a lot of hard work to be a performer, doesn’t it?**  

YM: Yeah. In terms of staple songs, _Tachiagare_ takes it because we’ve done it so many times that we’ve gotten somewhat comfortable performing it. In _7 Girls War_, we have to keep our focus up, else we blow our voices or run out of stamina before the end. My natural voice register is low so I have to strain myself to reach higher notes, which makes it more likely for me to overexert.  

**\-- In regard to** **_Tachiagare_** **and** **_7 Girls War_****, since both you and Aoyama-san have established solo parts, both of you must feel the pressure not to mess up.**  

YM: And both of us are the type who easily rattled once we do so we definitely can't let that happen.  

**\-- You also get to showcase SKKK, the main song for the first sequel movie. How will it go?**  

YM: The dance has flowing movements, coupled with moments of fierceness. It's a difficult song to perform at our best but it’s the type of dance I feel that I'm good at as it has some ballet and jazz influences to it. Overall, I think this song has a completely different feel to it.  

**\-- Is there a part of the show that you want to highlight?**  

YM: Personally, I want everyone to enjoy the shadow narrations that we perform before the event. (laughs)

**\-- Because you wrote them?**  

YM: Yeah. I'm responsible for the script and it was something I knew I could do. This time I wrote different scripts for all 8 shows. Each venue gets a different pair of characters, and I wrote the dialogue with their character dynamics in mind.  

**\-- Did you plan this because you wanted to add more variety to the shadow narrations compared from last year?**  

YM: Yes. We won't have long MC portions for this tour so I'm aiming to make these shadow narrations feel unique for each venue. I apologize in advance for those who come to the show not getting to hear their favorite but I hope you get to enjoy it. And for those who go to multiple venues, be sure to know that the afternoon and night narrations are different.  

**\-- How about the live performances? Any highlights worth noting?**  

YM: There will be songs that we won't perform as all seven of us. Instead, we will be split into groups of two and five members and these songs will showcase our characters’ individual personalities so be sure not to miss it.  

**\-- What do you personally want to accomplish for this tour?**  

YM: I want it to feel like a live tour, not just an event. I want it to emphasize our ability to sing and dance. For that, we deliberated on the setlist and we even have a song that we choreographed ourselves. I want this tour to push our personalities in front of everyone and show a whole new side of us that is different from the first tour.

\[This display of initiative continued as they became more involved in their events. They eventually decided entire setlists for small events but especially for the 4th Live Tour, which Mayu decided with Airi when they unexpected got the OK to do it.  
  
In Final Tour, they go all out with ideas unique to their personal tastes and intentions. Karaoke showcases, comedy skits, DJ shows, choir performances, etc.\]

**\-- Finally, with the start of the 2nd live tour kicking off the latter half of the year for WUG, how do you wish to spend it?**  

YM: I'm glad to say that new stories with the girls will come with the release of the sequel movies. It's a new opportunity for hopefully more people to learn and appreciate WUG. At the same time, we, as a unit, will step up as well as we bring out the best performances for everyone. And of course, I will do my best for my solo activities. Last year's tour happened in tandem with _Hanayamata_'s activities, which was tough on both Kaya (Okuno Kaya) and Minyami (Tanaka Minami). Moving forward, I hope to learn how to manage and take good care of myself as I work harder.
