**\-- A few announcements came with the release of _Wake up, Girls! Beyond the Bottom_ in December last year. Can you tell me about them?**  
  
Aoyama Yoshino (AY): Right. First of those was a talk show event for February in Taiwan! We’ve performed overseas in Chicago \[ACEN 2014\] before but this was our first time in Asia. We’ve received flowers before from fans in Taiwan, and we’re grateful that they would fly all the way here just to see us. Now, it was our turn!  

**\-- You’ll also be having a similar talk-and-live event in Sendai Airport this coming week. This must be a new experience since you’ve mostly performed in theater halls.**  
  
AY: It’s a pleasant surprise. I didn’t even know you could hold concerts inside airports! (laughs) Admission is free so a lot of people will get to see us.

**\-- I’m also looking forward to the anime shorts! Having been to Sendai numerous times, what’s your favorite spot?**  
  
AY: I have wandered around the city on free days before our live tours and I like the metropolitan feel of Kukubuncho! As part of Wake Up, Girls!, we go to Sendai at least once a month. This is where we started so it is a place I hold dear to me, and hopefully, I get to find more places to appreciate the next time I go there.  

**\-- By the way, I’ve heard many people say that you’ve gotten prettier. (laughs)**  
  
AY: People have told me that lately~. I don’t know what changed but maybe I’ve gotten cuter somehow. (laughs) I’m the reserved type who usually keeps her thoughts to herself but lately, I feel that it’s better to say what’s on your mind than having to sugarcoat it, for better or for worse. (laughs)

[\[Sure enough, this culminated in an event that happened during Final Tour Part III in her hometown of Kumamoto. You can read about it via Insti's event report by clicking this block.\]](http://oha.yoppi.moe/2019/01/05/yoshinos-tree/)

**\-- (laughs) So how do you goof off on your personal time?**  
  
AY: I don’t goof off. (laughs) Well, I guess I do. Whenever I have time, I play games on my phone. I have played _Shironeko Project_ for 12 hours straight before and I always play it when a new character comes out. (laughs)  

**\-- Looking at your respective blogs, several members seem to be playing it too. That and watching _Haikyuu_.**  
  
AY: I may have been the one that started it. (laughs) I’m also watching _Mr. Osomatsu_ and now everyone else seems to be more into it than me. (laughs) I guess there’s something about it that resonates with them.

![青山吉能](/images/aoyama_002.jpg)

**\-- _Mr. Osomatsu_ is pretty mainstream right now, especially with its topical humor. (laughs) Who is your favorite among the sextuplets?**  
  
AY: That’s a tough question. I like them all equally, but if I were to choose, it would be Jyushimatsu Matsuno. (laughs) There was a time where I woke up at 6:30 in the morning to attend the Ninjatown event \[A collaboration event with Namco\]! I wasn’t able to go when they were in Kumamoto, so I had to make do just admiring them from afar. (sinister laugh)  

**\-- Things we do as fans... (laughs). As an anime and manga fan, which work do you consider a must-read?**  
  
AY: _Samurai Deeper Kyo,_ for sure! It’s a series I love dearly and it was a surprise when I learned that it’s as old as I am. I love the author (Kamijyo Akimine) and the world she created, and you can really see the passion she has for her work when you read her postscript at the end of every volume. I have all her published works!  

\[Yoppi has strict parents and often forbade her from keeping anime-related stuff. With one notable exception, an English volume of Samurai Deeper Kyo that her sister bought for her from Australia. They let her keep that somehow, probably because she couldn’t read it.\]  

**\-- What about her other works?**  
  
AY: I’ve read _Shirogane no Karasu_ and watched the _CØDE:BREAKER_ anime adaptation! Right now, I’ve been reading through _Tansansuibu_ which is being published by Evening \[A bi-weekly seinen manga magazine\]. Actually, I was at a loss when _CØDE:BREAKER_ ended; I thought my life was over. So when I heard _Tansansuibu_ was out, I got a new lease on life. (laughs) Because I’m from the countryside, when a new volume gets released, I would go around town checking to see if anyone has it. And I also love her illustrations! They’re directed for younger male audiences, which is why it is published by Evening.

**\-- What are your anime influences?**  
  
AY: I’ve watched a lot of anime, but when I was in first year high school, I loved _Ano Natsu de Matteru_. The scene where Kanna-chan (Tanigawa Kanna) cut her hair left an impression on me. Her hair was so long but she ended up cutting it so short! (laughs). So in my audition picture for Wake up, Girls!, I adopted the same hairstyle. I was so against it when Yoshino-chan cut her hair because it was so embarrassing to think they still have that picture somewhere...  

**\-- (laughs) What kind of person were you during your school days?**  
  
AY: I think I was the kid who stood out the most in grade school. (laughs) I would always go around and invite my classmates to play dodgeball or some other game. But that all went away when I hit middle school and I became a closed-off bookworm.

**\-- What happened?**  
  
YM: I joined the chorus club. We had training starting from 7:30 in the morning, then class, then lunch and immediately into afternoon training, then evening training after we cleaned up for the day. We even had activities during summer break for Kyushu and national competitions. That’s all I did during middle school. I still treasure the friends I made during that time and we still keep in touch.  

**\-- Are you still making use of the experience from those days?**  
  
AY: Yes! I didn’t just learn how to sing, I also learned table etiquette and letter writing. They taught me how to use the knife and fork when we go out to eat during Nationals, and how to properly write letters of gratitude to staff members when we borrow their training halls using words like “Dear” and “Sincerely”. I still use those words when I write letters and I’m very thankful to have learned those skills.

\[In some of the member's birthday blog posts, they would mention her writing them long heartfelt letters via LINE or some other way.\]

**\-- Have you applied to other auditions before WUG?**  
  
AY: I’ve always wanted to become a voice actress since grade school, where I would speak using different voices and my friends would praise me for how cool it was, so I applied to numerous voice acting auditions. During _Milky Holmes’ “Search for Elly”_, I was within the final 30 candidates out of 8,000. I still remember the producer telling me that while I may still be in the first year of middle school, he’s looking forward to seeing me again and working with me once I’ve matured. His words really gave me hope. (laughs) Since then, no matter how many auditions I fail, I’d still keep going and the first I passed was the one for WUG.  

\[This particular audition is pretty popular in that numerous actresses connected to WUG members have applied for it. Sasaki Mikoi, who passed the audition, bonded over the experience with Okuno Kaya, and Toyama Nao was also a previous entrant.  

[\[She did eventually meet the producer for Shironeko Project https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/day-20180809.html](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/day-20180809.html)\]  

\[The impression Yoppi left on Director Yamamoto (According to the WUG vs Yamamoto Yutaka interview series back in 2014) was her stubbornness in becoming a voice actress. The story goes that, during screening, Yamakan told the candidates a “what if” scenario. “What if I said you’re all going home today?” Just about everyone felt dejected, except Yoppi, who stood her ground and said, “Then I’ll find another way to become a voice actress, come what may!”\]  

**\-- Did you ever imagine that you’d become a singer or dancer?**  
  
AY: Not at all. I only just wanted to become a voice actress. Actually, when we first took dancing lessons, I was confused because I thought there was no need for it. I thought, “Why do we have to dance?”. The other members were so good at it that I couldn’t keep up, which left me feeling discouraged.  

**\-- When did that impression change?**  
  
AY: It was during our 4th showcase event in 2013 at Akihabara UDX. Our dance instructor told me that I was totally hopeless and it broke me to tears. (laughs) I really felt that it was impossible but I was the leader, I can’t just let that hold me back. So I told myself to let go and focus on getting better.  

\[Recently, she did the choreography support and motion capture for _Harukana Receive_ EP 7 OP, which also left her just as confused that she was asked to do it, thinking that they may have gotten the wrong person (the director specifically asked for her).\]

**\-- When was the turning point for you on your role as Nanase Yoshino?**  
  
AY: Episode 7, definitely. There were so many lines that I had to do while crying. I could read the lines well, and I understood the direction, but I just couldn’t pull it off emotionally. But after some help, I was finally able to get into Yoshino-chan’s character.  

![青山吉能](/images/aoyama_004.jpg)

**\-- Do you feel like you’ve gotten better at acting?**  
  
AY: I still find challenging. When I watch _Beyond the Bottom_, I can see places where I didn’t do as well as I had hoped or could have done better if I projected it differently. Even with _The Last Ship_, where I’m part of the regular dub cast. I enjoy listening to my own voice so I have watched it a lot, but the experience also taught me delivery styles that I wasn’t aware of before.  

\[This particular mention of _The Last Ship_ is important to Yoppi because she promised not to buy a TV until she’s a regular cast in a project.\]  

**\-- Moving forward, what do you seek to improve in your acting?**  
  
AY: I’m still in college so I’m not as free as I want to be, that’s why I take every opportunity I get seriously. Even it’s a role as small as “Girl 1”, I take my time to completely understand her character so I can portray her well. I don’t think I’m exceptional, so I practice as well as I can so I can feel at least a little more prepared in front of the mic.  

\[Yoppi getting her role as Guri in _Love Tyrant_ was also significant to her because she thought that her voice wasn’t suited for a leading role.\]

**\-- What about your role as the leader do you feel proud about?**  
  
AY: I still feel like I’m not suited to be a leader. (laughs) Though I have been getting more solo parts in songs lately. (laughs) In i☆Ris, Serizawa Yuu and Himitasu (Akaneya Himika) has a lot of singing parts. And in WUG, Nanami and Minami get featured a lot, unlike me who only gets a few. (laughs) Maybe everyone feels like I’m not that good at all. (laughs) I mean they even called me “Gomiyama guzuo” \[Pun: A mountain of trash\] before. Isn’t that a little too much? (laughs) But that shows how close we are as a group. (laughs) I grateful that whatever my weaknesses are, they always have my back.  

**\-- So as the group’s leader, what do you hope will happen to WUG this year?**  
  
AY: I want to make ourselves known and show everyone who we are, so there are things worth looking forward to in the future. I want to showcase our individual talents, and I want to see our group shine brighter on bigger stages.  

\[Yoppi is always the butt of jokes in the group, and has the most frequent mentions from other members’ blog posts about something she did, usually a goof, a sleepover, a date, or a kind gesture. That said, they also mention her coming through when it matters, as she gives good pep talks before every show, and worries about others’ well-being. She worried the most about the 2014 Anisama mic incident, and there was one occasion when she gave Nanami a free coffee coupon after a hectic work week as “Good job!” present.\]

**\-- As for yourself, what kind of voice actress do you hope to become?**  
  
AY: I want to work in this industry for as long as I live, so I want to become a voice actress that everyone will want to work with. I love doing this work more than anyone else, and while that sentiment is pretty commonplace, I believe my passion will carry me through!

**\-- And as a student and an individual, what are things that you want to try out?**  
  
AY: A seaside barbecue would be one thing. (laughs) I’m a bit of a loafer in my days off because I just play games all day. But if only I had… friends to… invite me… It’s so hard to say! (laughs) But right now, I’d rather work than take breaks!  

**\-- Finally, any words you want to impart to our readers?**  
  
AY: This interview has been a long time coming. Sorry for taking so long. I’m also an avid reader of this column, so I already prepared what I would say and wear when my turn comes. (laughs) I got to talk more about a different me from my usual WUG self, so hopefully you keep supporting me! Thank you!  

**\-- Thank you for sitting in for this interview!**
