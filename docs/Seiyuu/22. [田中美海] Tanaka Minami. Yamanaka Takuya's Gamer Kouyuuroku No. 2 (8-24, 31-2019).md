**\[Part 1/2\] Voice actress and All-around Gamer. What's her first game?**

* * *

**First gaming hardware is the Gameboy Advance**

**\--Yamanaka Takuya (YT):** Let's begin. This is Yamanaka Takuya's Gamer _Kouyuuroku_, an interview series where I ask my colleagues about their gaming interests, which many people might not be aware of. I imagine this doesn't happen often since you usually talk about these things in a professional capacity in shows and other interviews.

**Tanaka Minami (TM):** It certainly doesn't.

**\--YT:** I hope this encourages a passion for games as well as relate your experiences to people in your generation who may be gamers as well. Going by your tweets, I noticed that you seem to enjoy playing games an awful lot. It’s like watching a cute little puppy in a dog park having the time of their life. (laughs)

**TM:** That's a good way of putting it. (laughs)

**\--YT:** It actually feels as if Twitter was made for you. Now that we’re on the topic, I have a question about games that relates to your personal life. I know you enjoy games that you can easily jump into during your free time, but what was the first game you ever played? What's the earliest experience you remember?

**TM:** My earliest memory would have to be the first gaming console I ever owned. It was a pink Gameboy Advance (GBA) that I got as a birthday present during 1st grade. The internet would have you believe that girls who get pink GBAs turn into _otakus_, which isn't true though it turned out that way for me, I guess. (laughs) Back then, I loved Hamtaro.

**\--YT:** Oh?! That explains our conversation about Hamtaro during our break at a Caligula event.

**TM:** Girls my age love Hamtaro! We would have played _Hamtaro: Ham-Hams Unite!_ on the GBA where you go around as Hamtaro as he rounds up all the little hamsters scattered in the world back into your underground clubhouse. Each of them would have their issues that you have to solve: one would demand a favor, one would be completely covered in mud, Oxnard would say, "I'm not going back until I have the legendary sunflower seed!". Hamtaro also gradually learns Ham-Chat words to talk or negotiate with them. The game was demanding, but I got so addicted to it.

</figure>

**\--YT:** It was a difficult game but I have to say... Hamtaro is a popular character that fits the general form of one. Can you recall when you first got into human characters that cater more to you as an "_otaku_"?

**TM:** It started with _Gakuen Alice ~Kira Kira Memory Kiss~_ on the PlayStation 2. These types of games were made just for me. You play a self-insert amnesiac transfer student as she tries to gain the affection of an attractive boy through skill-building activities. You keep playing until you end up either being close friends or in a romantic relationship with someone, and it can be surprising how those endings turn out.

</figure>

**\--YT:** That’s an engaging formula and I can see how it can spark an interest in many other things.

**TM:** I got so into it during middle school because it feels like being in an anime. I came to this one a little late but I also got into _Little Busters!_. That was such an emotional ride. My friend lent me a copy and it was like being young again but in an entirely different way. I love games that let you make choices, games like _Detroit: Become Human_, for example.

\[According to the WUG blog, she often shared games with Miyu, usually visual novels.\]

**\--YT:** I’ve seen you talking about that lately and right now it's free to play along with _The Caligula Effect: Overdose_ (\*Only for PlayStation Plus members and the free play period is over) so I imagine a lot more people are playing it as well especially with its popularity. What got you into it?

**TM:** I like how choices can affect things way down the line and it has a flowchart at the end that shows how much more you could have learned. A character could just die all of a sudden even with the best intentions... I even reached an ending that was completely different from what I wanted. It's almost like there's a spirit inside the game raining misfortune on me...

**\--YT:** Whose only purpose is to make things harder for you...

**TM:** When it showed the world percentage stats at the end that displayed what everyone did, my choices were at zero percent. It bothered me so much I asked my little sister and she said it was because barely anyone made those choices to even register a single digit… It’s not like I was aiming for a bad ending. I didn’t consult a walkthrough, did what I felt was right, and it ended up that way. But as with otome games, it did get me fired up to do better for the next run.

**\--YT:** My friend got the best ending right away and couldn't play it again, so I think it might even be more motivating to fail at first try. Have you played it again since then?

**TM:** I finished another run and it was terrible… I kept getting into routes that I knew wouldn’t end well. Then I became more desperate as it went on and got the worst ending. (laughs)

\[At this point, she had already done four playthroughs, bad endings in all of them.\]

**\--YT:** I guess you could say misfortune follows you wherever you go. I remember when I first met you for a game recording. You were around twenty by then and my first impression as we interacted was that you were very composed and mature. Since then, I learned that there were completely different sides to you which I, and your fans as well I imagine, find intriguing.

* * *

**Enjoying games in all genres**

**\--YT:** We’ve talked a lot about choice-based adventure games but I want to ask if you have a favorite genre. You seem like the type who plays all kinds of games but… I also have a feeling that you have a preference for the darker and more disturbing genres.

\[During WUGchannel’s horror game playthroughs, nothing could shake her and she enjoyed the entire experience instead, especially in _Resident Evil 7_ as she tried to run over Jack Baker (first encounter) with the car.\]

**TM:** I suppose I do play all sorts of games. I enjoy RPGs like _Dragon Quest_, and I played _Zelda: Breath of the Wild_, which I got around the same time I bought a Nintendo Switch. I also enjoy puzzle games like _Tetris_.

I also play mobile games such as _Fate/Grand Order_ (FGO), _PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS_ (PUBG), _Identity V_, and social deduction games like _Werewolf_. I particularly enjoy games that let me team up, chat, and play with others.

I remember playing open-mic rounds of PUBG with Yamashita Nanami, Takagi Miyu plus some random stranger, and we would always try to get our fourth member to play along with us. We even use codenames and go like "Let’s get em’, Mentai-tamago!” (laughs)

\[The WUG members started playing PUBG mobile around the time of the second WUG theater, _Aoba no Kiseki_, where it became their go-to breaktime game with the rest of the cast and has since been played in gaming programs by Nanami. _Identity V_ (mobile game that plays similarly to _Dead by Daylight)_ was Kaya’s go-to game while the mobile iteration of _Werewolf_ was their tried-and-true breaktime game that they’ve played with everyone almost like a ritual.\]

**\--YT:** Wouldn’t that freak people out?! I remember doing an escape room a long time ago with Takeuchi Shinsuke_\-kun_ and a few others who I worked with in _The Caligula Effect_. It was me and seven other voice actors split into teams of two and I ended up being paired with someone I didn’t know and I felt out of place the whole time because it was a different crowd who knew each other well.

**TM:** I think it’s still a better experience playing with at least someone instead of on your own!

**\--YT:** You have a point... What about the social deduction games you mentioned earlier?

**TM:** There was a period where I really got into them. I’ve gotten a bit over that now but I still enjoy watching other people play and seeing them go, “Gotcha!!”

I also watch live streams. I’m a fan of horror games. I even played the first _Resident Evil_.

**\--YT:** I’ve seen videos of you playing horror games and you don’t seem fazed with them at all. In fact, you were laughing the whole time. It makes me wonder if there’s even a genre that you won’t play or haven’t tried yet.

**TM:** Yeah. It gets me thinking too since I also play games like _Mario Kart_ as well as vertical shooters.

**\--YT:** You really seem ready and willing to try every genre under the sun and that’s good since it makes you more receptive to ideas, which I believe is an invaluable trait to have when you’re into games. It gives you a wider range of preferences, kind of like an antenna reaching out in all directions since we tend to look for things similar to those we like.

It must be tough managing the time to play games amid your busy work schedule and I imagine you have less time to even play games at all compared to when you were little. Do you have any games right now that are backlogged?

**TM:** I reached endgame in _Marvel’s Spider-Man_ but stopped progressing because there were still so many things to do. As a completionist, I want to finish everything, including the sidequests and I might not be able to anymore.

<figure>

</figcaption>

</figure>

**\--YT:** More and more open-world games have been coming out lately, particularly large ones, and they all make it almost impossible for completionists to clear everything.

Speaking of which, I just watched the new movie _Spiderman: Far From Home_.

**TM:** I’ve yet to see it! I’ve already watched _Avengers: Endgame_, at least.

**\--YT:** It was so engaged it kept me hanging at the edge of my seat. It instantly got me to check out _Marvel Strike Force_. 

**TM:** I've been seeing ads for that lately.

**\--YT:** Now that it’s been brought up, who is your favorite hero in the Avengers?

**TM:** A lot of them are awesome but I’m a fan of the Scarlet Witch and Antman. Especially Antman, a lot wouldn’t have happened without him.

**\--YT:** He’s definitely one of the breakthrough characters along with the Guardians of the Galaxy. Tom Holland is adorable and his character's relationship with Tony Stark (Iron Man) was very heartwarming.

Let’s move to another topic. Way back when the only way for me to get games is through birthday presents and I had to choose carefully because I’d be stuck with that game regardless of whether I ended up liking them or not.

**TM:** When I was little, I only get games on special occasions like my birthday or Christmas. Now that I’m older, it is nice that I can just buy games whenever I want but… I don’t play games the way I used to where I’d aim to complete the _PokeDex_ in a _Pokemon_ game. And lately, I’ve been missing the times where I could just stick to a game for an entire year. (laughs)

**\--YT:** It’s just so easy to get a game once it’s out.

**TM:** Exactly. Then it would slip out of my mind for a long while until I feel the urge to play it. Back then, I’d check for news right after school and that feels so long ago now…

* * *

**Focusing on heart-wrenching stories! Debora for life!**

**\--YT:** What're your most important criteria when picking a game?

**TM:** It’s the story and whether or not it gets me invested enough to make me cry. That’s what I’m looking for in any medium, whether it’s games or movies. _Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride_ (DQV) drove me to tears and I wasn’t expecting such a powerful story like that going into it.

**\--YT:** How old were you then?

**TM:** I played the DS port around... middle school, I think.

**\--YT:** In that case… Can I ask you the age-old question?

**TM:** Here we go! I read about this in the previous interview with Nakamura-san! Mine’s Debora. It’s not even a contest because she’s completely different from the other two!

\[The question is basically who is best girl in DQV, arguably the best and most celebrated _Dragon Quest_ game, and the choices are usually between the possible spouses for the Hero: Bianca, Nera, and Debora (exclusive to the DS and mobile ports).\]

**\--YT:** She’s an awesome character that it’s almost unfair to compare her to them. It flies in the face of the competition between Bianca and Nera because she’s so unconventional.

**TM:** I’ve been getting into two-faced characters lately, particularly ones that start out cold and become more affectionate over time. Bianca and Flora are very likable characters who have their hearts set on the Hero right from the get-go. Debora isn’t like that; you get to watch her develop, which makes it interesting because there’s a history that you can trace it back to.

**\--YT:** Debora hits all the right notes for those seeking the type of romance that expects you to pursue instead of being pursued, a rare outlier in the kinds of characters you see in mainstream RPGs like _Dragon Quest_. I’d have picked her too but only after going through Bianca and Nera so making her the first choice is pretty bold.

**TM:** And as female characters go, you usually don’t encounter strong types like her. It opens up the imagination, which I truly appreciate! Then by the end, you can’t help but be charmed by her.

**\--YT:** Do you laugh, cry, or talk to yourself as you follow the story?

**TM:** Of course I do. I’d shout, “Why?!”, “Stop!”, “No way!!!” during emotional moments.

**\--YT:** What game made you cry the most?

**TM:** Recently, it was _Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age_.

![](/images/dq11.jpg)

[Taken from the _Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age_ official JP website](https://www.dq11.jp/)

**\--YT:** It has such a strong compelling story. It has emotional periods as well as moments where it felt like you needed to take action to help someone.

**TM:** Exactly. I was already in tears from the start then when I realized what kind of story it was going to be, the emotional blows just keep hitting. At one point it was too much… That’s how sensitive I am to these things.

**\[Part 2/2\] Tanaka Minami’s favorite characters and a glimpse of her dream game!**

* * *

**Gaming obsessions --** **_Kirby’s Dream Land_****,** **_Monster Hunter Portable 3_****, and others.**

**\--YT:** Okay, how about we take a trip down memory lane. What were the games that got you really obsessed into playing? It could be anything, popular or otherwise.

**TM:** I’ll start with the _Kirby_ series. _Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land_ was so big during grade school that we used to exchange codes so we could play 4-player multiplayer together. It was that and _The Legendary Starfy_.

Then the very first Nintendo DS came out when I was around 2nd or 3rd grade. The popular kids would have it and they passed it around so everyone could play _WarioWare: Touched!_.

![](/images/wario.jpg)

**\--YT:** (Nakamura) Shugo and I had pretty similar experiences since we’re from the same generation and it’s startling hearing how times have changed... Did more people prefer to play with others?

**TM:** That’s how it was. If someone started a session of _Daigasso! Band Brothers_, everyone would join in. It was that widespread and a lot of people were already bringing portable consoles with them when I was little.

**\--YT:** It sounds like they’re carrying the activities they enjoy in their homes out into the world.

**TM:** That’s probably a good way of putting it. Ever since _Monster Hunter_ got big, it’s as if people are slowly shifting to playing games with others online.

**\--YT:** That's my thought as well. When you go online, do you have someone you regularly play with?

**TM:** I often play with my little sister. We tend to end up playing the same things together because she gets interested in things I’m into whenever I come home to visit. I also have a same-age cousin who often comes over during summer break.

**\--YT:** You’re okay with playing with strangers? Personally, I get a little anxious playing online with random people in an open setting.

**TM:** I’m totally fine with it! There was a Korean online RPG that I was completely into during grade school called _Chocotto Land Online_, and I got to hone my typing skills as well as my conversational skills chatting with people in the community.

![](/images/chocotto.jpg)

**\--YT:** You already had your PC of your own at home?

**TM:** I did! We had one that was practically mine.

**\--YT:** We didn’t have a PC at home when I was in high school, so I had to go to an electronics store just to use mixi. It had a public bulletin board where you can post pictures that you drew with a mouse and those became my first works of art online… It’s making me nostalgic thinking at how things used to be.

Going back to _Monster Hunter_, what was your first entry into the series?

**TM:** It’s probably _Monster Hunter Portable 3rd_ on the Playstation Portable. The series was becoming popular at the time and that was my first time playing a game where I get to craft my weapons using materials from monsters. It got me to play the rest of the series because it’s so fun.

**\--YT:** Didn’t it have a few issues that made it difficult to play?

**TM:** I got used to the camera right away so it wasn't an issue. My little sister got into it as well and I think she spent that summer break obsessively playing it with my cousin.

**\--YT:** If you don’t mind, what weapon did you main?

**TM:** I was a hammer user when I started but I’m using dual blades now! My little sister mains bow.

**\--YT:** A bow-wielder, huh… I can already picture the entire server asking for a “bow-wielding girl”, which sounds kind of fun. Since when did you start getting the games as soon as they release?

**TM:** Around 4th or 5th grade.

**\--YT:** And to think that _Monster Hunter World_ just came out a year ago... Wow. It’s giving me chills just thinking about the blinding pace of games right now.

* * *

**Favorite characters and tropes**

**\--YT:** Do you have a game in mind that you wish would get a sequel or a port?

**TM:** Not really. The stuff I like actually gets a lot of them.

**\--YT:** That does tend to happen with the big franchises, which I hear you play a lot of.

**TM:** I started the _Fate_ series with _Fate/stay night \[Realta Nua\]_ on the Playstation 2 and the series is still going strong. Same with _Uta no Prince-sama_ and I started with the otome game. I guess that happens for series that first came out as visual novels.

**\--YT:** Is there a game that you’re looking forward to right now?

**TM:** I’m curious about _Hypnosis Mic -Alternative Rap Battle-_. I’m wondering what kind of game it‘ll be. 

**\--YT:** The introduction of Doudantutuji Rokuro is making big waves right now. This probably isn’t on your radar but I’m looking forward to _WIND BOYS!_. It’s themed around male high school students and wind instruments, and it’s targeted toward a female audience because, I can only imagine, girls who are into games and anime have also played wind instruments at some point.

![](/images/windboys.jpg)

[Taken from _WIND BOYS!_ official website](http://windboys.jp/)

**TM:** I know about that! I actually enjoy going to a game’s website just to look for a character I like. There are way more characters now from when I last checked but my current favorite is Sano Tsugumi_\-kun_.

![](/images/sano.jpg)

**\--YT:** The character designs are top-notch. I also have a favorite and it’s Seomoon Ijeong_\-kun_. He’s a Korean idol who is also a transfer student. As someone who practically lives online, I find picking out favorite characters in games that have yet to come out really fun!

![](/images/seomoon.jpg)

On that note, since there are a lot of archetypes that cater to a female audience, do you have one that you normally gravitate toward?

**TM:** I do. I prefer those that lean toward _tsundere_ and _yanki_ types.

\[For the sake of consistency, I decided to keep _tsundere_ and _yanki_ as is and define them here in this context.  
  
_Tsundere_ characters are broadly described as having two very specific and very opposite apparent personalities: one being sweet and comforting, the other cold and brooding, sometimes spiteful.  
  
_Yanki_ characters are generally described as “delinquents” or “rebellious bad boys” who have the image and manner of being tough, scary, aggressive, and arrogant. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re bad people or actual delinquents who commit crimes.\]

**\--YT:** Do characters like Settsu Banri from _A3!_ count?

**TM:** I like him, though I prefer Hyodo Juza_\-kun_ if I had to choose. I got into it because of him and it’s a shame he didn’t make it into the Summer Troupe... speaking of which, I like Sumeragi Tenma_\-kun_ as well.

Also, isn’t _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ coming out in March? I’m can’t wait to play that. I’ve been into the series since it first came out and the unfortunate situations just keep getting tougher. Now it’s a deserted island and I wonder how that’ll work out... As someone who enjoys using the Nintendo Switch on handheld mode, I’ll play it that way for sure.

![](/images/animal.jpg)

[From the _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ JP website](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/acbaa/)

**\--YT:** And right on cue, the handheld mode-only Nintendo Switch Lite was just announced. I’m guessing there must be a lot of people who want to play games like _Pokemon_ and _Animal Crossing_ exclusively on handheld.

**TM:** I’m thinking of getting it once the new _Animal Crossing_ comes out.

**\--YT:** There’s also a new model coming out that has longer battery life. Are you planning on getting that as well?

**TM:** I’m interested in that too because the battery drains so quickly whenever I play on-the-go, such as during bullet train rides.

**\--YT:** And its current size makes it a... bit cumbersome in those places too because it attracts attention, so having a smaller model is great.

**TM:** I know what you mean!

* * *

**Memorable experiences in** **_The Caligula Effect_** **and** **_Death end re;Quest_**

**\--YT:** How about we pivot to another topic. When did you aspire to become a voice actress?

**TM:** It was during grade school. I was your typical anime fan, and I only became interested in becoming a voice actress when I entered 4th grade or so and learned that professionals who do voices for anime actually exist. It looked so fun and interesting because up until that point, all I had were silly aspirations like becoming a cakeshop owner or a patissier. At our school graduation ceremony, we were told to say who we want to be as we receive our diploma. That’s where I proudly proclaimed, “I'm going to be a voice actress!”

Since then, I joined the theater club in middle school, then the broadcasting club in high school. I even did some part-time jobs during high school so I could use the money to enroll in a vocational school. It was around that time when I found the \[_Wake Up, Girls_\] audition and passed… which has to be out of pure luck.

\[About clubs: She humorously recalled in early radio shows how she arbitrarily became president of both the theater club and broadcasting club. She became president of the theater club because everyone else was too busy doing cram school and other things, and she was the only one with free time when they approached the school advisor about it. She became president of the broadcasting club because her upperclassmen who headed the club were student council president and vice president and she inherited the role as they were graduating.\]

**\--YT:** And ever since, you've been voicing characters in both games and anime.

**TM:** I never would have expected that out of me, looking back. (laughs)

**\--YT:** We’re in different fields but I know the feeling. I feel fortunate that I can do this kind of work but I never once thought I’m here right now through my own efforts alone. I believe that there are, and have been since the beginning, a lot of women who enjoy games and anime, so I'm doing my best so my work can inspire and encourage them as well.

**TM:** I hope it does. As someone who prefers to be indoors, playing games is an important and inseparable part of my life.

**\--YT:** Since we’re on the topic, can you share any anecdotes or impressions about the games you’ve lent your voice to?

**TM:** I have two in mind since I love games that play with your heartstrings… One is _The Caligula Effect_.

**\--YT:** Good answer. (laughs) Readers, I didn't tell her to say that, just so you know...

\[Yamanaka Takuya is the director and overall concept designer of The Caligula Effect\]

**TM:** I still have vivid memories recording for it. I rarely get to voice main characters in mainstream games and the concept really caught my imagination!

![](/images/suzuna.jpg)

[Kagura Suzuna voiced by Tanaka Minami](http://www.cs.furyu.jp/caligula/od/character/suzuna.html)

**\--YT:** _The Caligula Effect_ is a bit unique though. (laughs)

**TM:** Really?! The ideas I got from the concept notes and the way the characters developed throughout the story made it a very fun role to play. I was so glad when _The Caligula Effect: Overdose_ was announced because it meant I get to be part of it again.

**\--YT:** I remember seeing how clearly into it you were during the recording sessions. It got me thinking that this thing I made just might be for people like you so I took it as a good sign of how well it will resonate with the “Tanaka Minami”s of the country.

**TM:** I felt it hit all the right notes!

**\--YT:** I also hear comments from time to time that it hit them in the right places as it played with their expectations. Your character Kagura Suzuna is also very down-to-earth and relatable to people's sentiments nowadays.

**TM:** I agree. She feels like someone I know whose problems I can easily relate to that I just want to make her happy. It makes you wonder how things ended up that way for her.

**\--YT:** I know. You’re absolutely right. During recording, I remember having conversations like how determined Suzuna was during the Musician Route to believe in the protagonist up to the bitter end. 

**TM:** She was crying out at how wrong it all was. But of course… you know what happens in the end. I completely understand how she felt. She earnestly believed in him… even through the pain.

\[Spoilers regarding Musician Route: It’s the “evil” route where the protagonist betrays the entire party and fights them at the end.\]

**\--YT:** Well said. Who would even think of doing something that cruel...

Since I’ve already mentioned Shugo, who also lent his voice for _The Caligula Effect_, it’s a common practice for mainstream games to hire veteran actors to do voices in them. But for this one, I wanted to emphasize younger talent who can grow together and I’m wondering if it was able to accomplish that...

**TM:** I did notice that the cast list was full of familiar names, and a lot of them in the same generation, when I read the project notes. Since I was new to that kind of recording environment, I stayed close and listened to my seniors like Ueshama (Ueda Reina).

The other game I have in mind is Compile Heart’s _Death end re;Quest_. It also explores the nature of emotions. My character Al Astra had forgotten the feeling of sadness and she became quite a bubbly mood maker as a result while she grappled with her circumstances. It all came to a head when her sadness came gushing out and doing that scene left a strong impression on me.

![](/images/al.jpg)

[Al Astra voiced by Tanaka Minami](https://www.compileheart.com/derq/chara/?page=al)

**\--YT:** I can see how both games struck a chord with you. It felt like they set out to leave some sort of mark against current JRPG trends.

**TM:** I agree. It was neat that I happened to work on these games whose stories I resonated deeply with. I also got the chance to voice other kinds of characters so I learned a lot in the process. And approaching it as a player was fun because I got to experience the story for what it is as well as encounter sides of myself that I don’t usually show.

**\--YT:** It makes me glad to hear that as a creator. Thank you so much.

* * *

**Dream of playing a** **_yanki_****\-themed otome game in VR!**

**\--YT:** This is just wishful thinking but what’s the ideal game for you?

**TM:** Hmm… A VR otome game. There’s a handful of them out there but I wish they could be longer… though I might end up never leaving the house anymore if it ever comes true. (laughs)

**\--YT:** Speaking of longer visual novel games in VR, _Tokyo Chronos_ is already out and it has a near-future vibe to it. Also, I heard Yuki Aoi_\-san_ is producing all kinds of goods for FGO. Have you ever thought of doing something like that?

**TM:** I’d love to do it if I could. I’ll make something along the lines of _HiGH＆LOW_ and _Gokusen_ where it’s _yanki_\-themed… like an otome game called _Yanki Academy (subject to change)_. I’ll obsess so hard on the story and everything but at the very least I’d want some things to get decided through baseball matches! And it’s going to be full of every _yanki_ that you can think of—Intelligent. Straight-laced. Boyish. Mohawk. Quiet. Rowdy. Everything.

**\--YT:** I’m more than willing to work on the script... (laughs) Let’s gather interested parties and recruit the talent! Hanae Natsuki_\-san_ is a popular name but newer voices have been getting into games as well. Would you be interested in that?

**TM:** I’m totally on-board! I'll wait for it to finish while I live stream games at home. (laughs)

**\--YT:** Isn’t that just slacking off...?! I also stream occasionally. it can be lonesome doing it alone as you stare at the screen trying to stay awake, but seeing the audience respond to what you do is fun. I can see why people want to do it as a job.

**TM:** I’m always game to do those!

**\--YT:** All right. It's about time to close this off with the final question—What is gaming to you?

**TM:** For me, gaming is… This might sound a little vague but gaming is “Life”. It’s been with me wherever I am, and just hearing a nostalgic tune is enough to evoke memories that take me back to who I was at the time. It’s something I can’t help but be enthusiastic about so I want to cherish every memory and every feeling I experience from it.
