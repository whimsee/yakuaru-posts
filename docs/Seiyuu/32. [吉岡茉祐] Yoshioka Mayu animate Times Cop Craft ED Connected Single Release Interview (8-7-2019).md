Set in Kariana Island's City of San Teresa, where a gate to another world has appeared nearby in the Pacific leading to the co-existence of races from both worlds, _Cop Craft_ is a buddy police action story that follows detective duo Kei Matoba (CV: Tsuda Kenjiro) and Tilarna Exedilica (CV: Yoshioka Mayu) as they tackle various crimes of a special and otherworldly nature.

While it is one of many works in the isekai genre, the release of the ending theme _Connected_ piqued my interest. That's because it is sung by Yoshioka Mayu. With her captivating vocals, I was taken in by the song’s expression of strength and fragility, and its sense of suppressed gentleness and steadfast conviction. It's a superb song in many ways and it's not an exaggeration that her portrayal of Tilarna endeared me to the character.

In this interview, I asked her a few questions about _Connected_ and _Nonfiction_, and along the way, I also came out of it impressed with her growth as a talent who has done work in multiple fields such as anime, theater, writing, drama reading, among others.

**"Tilarna's singing!"**

![](/images/5d4948148e64c_bd4c2728ed686fb6791420afe174df3e.jpg)

**\-- What did you feel when they approached you to perform the ending theme to _Cop Craft_****?**

**Yoshioka Mayu (YM):** Well, I was already overjoyed when I got cast for the role for Tilarna via audition, so I never expected singing the ending theme. I initially assumed someone else was going to do it (laughs) so it really came as a huge and a very pleasant surprise.

\[The director, Itagaki Shin, is also the director of _Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou_. He specifically noted in the interviews following the announcement of the cast that while he did work with her, it didn't play a part in his decision to cast her for the role of Tilarna.\]

![](/images/5d493f0e4bb43_20b6c961d310d7436ff3505d4f11d713.jpg)

**\-- It surprised me as well. It's technically a character song but it is still you singing the ending theme.**

**YM:** That's right. I love singing so I've always hoped I get to do an ending theme someday. It’s also a huge responsibility being cast as the lead heroine and singing the ending theme, so this makes it an invaluable experience for me.

https://youtu.be/NcED\_ChDtHs

**\-- What was going through your head when you first listened to Connected?**

**YM:** It’s an ending theme so I initially imagined it to be a more mellow mid-tempo song, but it turned out to be an honest-to-goodness rock song! It’s my favorite genre so I felt delightfully grateful that it was going to be done in this style, and listening to the demo inspired me to think of _Connected_ as a way to draw out Tilarna’s commanding presence.

![](/images/5d49482f19963_522f92cd11487535fc51bf2c9418b397.jpg)

**\-- There’s definitely an assumption for those songs to be either ballads or mid-tempo pieces so hardly anyone would expect it to be a rock song.**

**YM:** And as anime themes go, an uptempo opening theme is usually complemented by a relatively slower ending theme.

**\-- Exactly. The intensity of it took me by surprise just as I finished watching the first episode.**

**YM:** It’s a display of Tilarna’s many facets, or in this case, the fact that she can sing. I remember being impressed when I first saw the video after finishing one of our recording sessions. The staff was very excited, telling everyone that “Tilarna is singing!” (laughs)

**\-- It was that exciting?**

**YM:** Yeah. I got a little carried away too. (laughs)

**_Connected_****’s Highlights and The "Yoshioka Style"**

![](/images/5d493f2d2a5ec_5ccf9debcb33590d0ad2d562c2689721.jpg)

**\-- So far, you’ve done quite a lot of songs for characters such as 4U’s Wanibuchi Emoko in Tokyo 7th Sisters, Kirishima Sakura in Hundred, among others. Tilarna has a surprisingly cute and child-like quality to her for a mature 26-year-old, so with those experiences under your belt, what approach did you take for her?**

**YM:** I didn’t have to change my voice that much for her so I was able to express myself naturally, which was very important for the anime. The director was present when we recorded and he advised me to invoke my interpretation of awe and pride into my singing. So I didn’t hold back and put a lot of power into it and in the process, I was able to draw out Tilarna’s chivalrous sense of pride and inner strength.

**\-- So it’s due to your interpretation that Tilarna sounds very commanding.**

**YM:**  I was able to sing the way I wanted to. I even got to use my techniques and belted out in some parts and sung vibrato in others so I could impart more personality to the song.

\[Correction from the previous interview: I wrote that she wasn't allowed to sing vibrato. It has since been fixed.\]

![](/images/5d493f3912430_8f12bfca6d8da9151163a19884d468d4.jpg)

**\-- I got that impression, especially during the chorus. It felt like it had your trademark singing style that seemed different from the rest of the song, if you get what I mean.** 

**YM:** I do. It sounds a bit nasally and the staff even started calling it the “Yoshioka style”. (laughs) I got to use it frequently here even though Tilarna is supposed to be the one singing. (laughs)

**\-- (laughs) Thank you. Moving on, which part of the song stands out to you the most?**

**YM:** There’s no chorus after the second verse. It immediately enters the interlude after I belt out the final note as the song starts to open up. The guitar riffs in that section are so cool, it gave me goosebumps the first time I listened to it so I highly recommend that part.  
  
Yasuno Yuta-san wrote, composed, and arranged _Connected_. He got to incorporate a lot of awesome band and guitar arrangements, so I encourage everyone to give it a listen.

**\-- I felt that as well, though I also liked how the first verse started.**

**YM:** Oh yeah! It's in Farbani.

![](/images/5d494865913c7_a6fc6c24103138ddb0af98b4973ffce6.jpg)

**\-- What are they trying to say?**

**YM:** The first one's _Neeve Shieya_ which roughly means "good night" or "sweet dreams". The next is _Dasshu Zanna_ which means "thank you". They're spoken in the anime so it should be familiar to anyone who watches it.

\[As of yet, there’s no official spelling for ネーヴェ・シーヤ and ダーシュ・ザンナ so I’m currently going with Neeve Shieya and Dasshu Zanna, respectively.\]

**\-- Didn't you mention in the radio show _Cop Craft Tokubetsu Kouhouhan_** **\[TL: Special Promotion Squad\] that you had trouble with the Farbani's pronunciation?**

**YM:** I only needed to match the intonation with the melody but I aimed for a delivery that sounds vaguely like English and Japanese so it can serve as a hook for the rest of the song.

**_Nonfiction_, Tilarna’s Feminine Side**

https://youtu.be/EoaxyA-uTUA

**\-- I’d like to ask about the other song that is coupled with this single, _Nonfiction_****. I heard a lot of work was put into it.**

**YM:** _Nonfiction_ is written and composed by RIRIKO-san, who is actually the same age as me, and she took a more feminine approach to Tilarna.  
  
While _Connected_ is a solid rock song that displays her sense of pride, _Nonfiction_, according to her as she read the entire source material, depicts the gentler and more feminine aspects of her character.   
  
Throughout the story, Tilarna grapples with her wavering emotions and goes face to face with her sense of justice as it clashes against what she sees as an unjust interpretation of it. She meets all kinds of people and discovers new things, which helps her reconcile these doubts. That’s what _Nonfiction_ is trying to tell. It even includes spoken lines from her.

![](/images/5d493f5f0a44e_c8ac862a8791545716b5700c08689524.jpg)

**\-- Are those the ones before the chorus?**

**YM:** Yes. This isn’t on the script itself but they're alluding to a "someone". As to who that could be… that’s something to ponder while listening to the song.  
  
It has lots of callbacks to the anime that might get you thinking so I recommend paying attention to them especially after you finish watching through the entire anime series.

**\-- The phrase "_hitori de wa nai. Mou, hitori ni wa sasenai_****" \[TL: You're not alone. I won't let that happen anymore.\]  leaves quite an impression.**

**YM:** That’s my favorite one. It makes you wonder… who is she telling that to? I hope everyone keeps that in mind as they listen.

**\--  That’s definitely some food for thought. Now, I want to ask about the song’s notably distinct rock arrangement.**

**YM:** It’s contemporary rock and singing this was very difficult. I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s the hardest one I’ve done to date.

**\-- Really?! I thought you've done so many difficult songs at this point!**

**YM:** That’s true. (laughs) I’ve done songs that had unconventional rhythms and varying pitches but _Nonfiction_ is on a completely different level.

**\-- How tough was it to record?**

**YM:** I could never feel satisfied with the first half of the verse sections. They just didn’t feel right to me so I kept asking to re-record them.

**\-- That's a surprise since I get the impression that your recording sessions always went without any issues.**

**YM:** We spent a lot of time trying all kinds of ideas along the way.

![](/images/5d493f74caf70_13e9a0ea52054bc0399f80f580a965c1.jpg)

**\-- What’s your favorite part?**

**YM:** I like how the spoken parts mix things up, and… Oh, right. The bridge is pretty out of the ordinary. It’s a blend of high, mid, and low tones with lines in both English and Japanese, which gives it a very profound vibe as it leads to the final chorus. That’s my favorite part.

**\-- This question just occurred to me, are you going to sing these songs for your Sofmap AKIBA live event on August 17?**

**YM:** (Checks with staff) I will! Finally! I’m currently practicing them for the show. Because the songs were made to be performed live, I hope to see everyone there.

**A Buddy-buddy Relationship** 

![](/images/5d4b70de01a42_35b1d9eb7550c3c27634326415e323d2.jpg)

**\-- Let's talk about _Cop Craft_****. I'd like to ask about Tsuda Kenjiro. What kind of buddy is he? I heard that you ended up doing the first episode of the radio show on your own.**

**YM:** That episode felt so lonely. Tsuda-san is very friendly, humble, easy to talk to, and he tends to hold himself back that he comes off as quite reserved. There’s a huge gap between us in terms of age and experience, but he’s someone I feel like I can relate to and be on the same level with.

**\-- At our previous interview, you mentioned that your decision to branch out into different fields was a turning point for you as a voice actress. Since Tsuda-san is much like that too in that he also does theater, TV dramas, movies, radio and others on top of his voice acting career, I can imagine you both relating to each other in that regard as well.**

[\[The interview being referenced was actually translated (WUG Shin Shou Interview Series #12) and linked in this note.\]](https://posts.yakuaru.com/WUG/Wake%20Up,%20Girls!%20Shin%20Shou%20animate%20Interview%20Series%20No.%2012%20(1-11-2018)%20Polaris%20Interview.%20Thoughts%20and%20Feelings%20about%20Tohoku,%20Sendai,%20Fans%20and%20supporters)

**YM:** We always sit together in the studio and whenever we talk, it’s always a different topic and it’s never about anime. (laughs)

![](/images/5d4949c99f91d_ec43bd6e0f62f16b78e1f2057915a347.jpg)

**\-- What kind of things do you talk about?**

**YM:** It depends. If it’s about my writing, we would get into the things I write. One time Tsuda-san mentioned that he’s an avid photographer so we started talking about his shot preferences. It’s funny because we’re working on an anime but we never talk about it all. (laughs) Still, getting to talk about a variety of topics is fun.

**\-- I think of it as creating good chemistry that comes across in the actual performance.**

**YM:** It does. Actually, it isn't just Tsuda-san. A lot of the cast members do work in different fields as well, especially theater. Some were even appearing in ongoing shows at the time. It's an environment where I found a lot of kindred spirits which is something I don’t usually experience.

\[Mayu grew up doing theater since she was 4 years old but in terms of documented experience, her first show was in 2012 and since her voice acting debut in 2014, she consistently did theater gigs (SOLID STAR initially but eventually branching out to other productions starting 2018) while juggling WUG and college duties.\]

**Moving Forward with Multiple Talents**

![](/images/5d4b70f25f10e_fa48792f448db5a03d943d43e0f3fd5f.jpg)

**\-- Yoshioka-san, I see you as a person with multiple skill sets. You do voice acting, live shows, theater, reading dramas, live streams, and many others. I'd like to know your goal.**

**YM:** I want to be someone who can do anything and everything. _Cop Craft_ is one step toward that as it gets me thinking about the trials and joys of working with anime. Even when it gets difficult, I see it as an invaluable learning experience and a way for me to deepen my understanding about acting so that someday I can impress people with the variety of things I can do.

**\-- Speaking of which, you were dropping hints recently about new things you were working on. Can you give a little more information about them?**

**YM:** I’m working on a live reading show for September called  〜いろいろ詰め込んでみました〜 \[[_~iroiro yomekondemimashita~_](https://twitter.com/iroirotsumekomi)\]. It’s the first time I get to be a producer where I can really dive into all the nitty-gritty details that go into producing a show.  
  
The other one has to do with my writing (\*) so keep an eye out for that.

(\*This is referring to あの星に願いを \[[_Ano hoshi ni negai wo_](https://twitter.com/log_toshi/status/1152145635006541824?s=20)\], a reading drama entirely written by Mayu that will be held in November 6-10)

\[She mentioned in a MyCloset segment that the entire thing took about a year to write (and she bounced ideas around with the WUG members, Yoppi most of all) and she had some involvement in picking the actors for the show.\]

**\-- Thank you. That’s definitely something your fans can get excited for. I hope you don’t mind me pointing this out but you seem happy lately.**

**YM:** I’ve been in a group for so long that I worried how lonely it would feel once I’m on my own but thankfully I’ve been getting opportunities to do all sorts of projects that it hasn’t gotten to that point at all. If anything, I’ve been having a lot of fun learning new things so I can’t stress enough how grateful I feel right now.

![](/images/5d4b7103ea658_48a9e2e3fade609b89c53ae9d8bce6a9.jpg)

**\-- On a scale of 1 to 100, how contended do you feel right now?**

**YM:** What?! Hmm… A passing grade would be 60 and there’s still I want to do so I’ll go with 70. (laughs)

**\-- You gave 65 in our previous interview.**

**YM:** It went up a little, then. (laughs)

**\-- And I think that’s a good thing. Finally, any messages you want to say your fans who are following the anime and are looking forward to the single?**

**YM:** I give full credit for those five points to _Cop Craft_ because it gave me opportunities to act, sing, even do a show. I’m very grateful for Tilarna as one of the characters I cherish that I want to pour all my heart and soul into every live show and broadcast, with the hope that I can get more people to come and appreciate _Cop Craft, Connected_, and _Nonfiction_.

**\-- Thank you for the wonderful answers!**
