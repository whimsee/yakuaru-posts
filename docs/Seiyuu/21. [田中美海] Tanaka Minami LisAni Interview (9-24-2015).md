**\-- How's work going for you lately?**  

Tanaka Minami (TM): I don't think much has changed for me compared to the other members who moved to Tokyo this year. I've been getting a lot of work and I've been super busy since June. Of course, a huge part of it was tour rehearsals and we also had more songs to perform this time so it feels altogether more hectic than before. It's like I go home only to sleep. (laughs) That said, I feel like I'm doing better physically. I don't feel as exhausted anymore and my voice is in good condition.  

**\-- I get what you mean by the summer mostly revolving around the tour. But now that it’s wrapped up, how do you feel?**  

TM: We did more songs, some of which were new. It was something we wanted to do for this time. We wanted it to be more like a concert, but we also weren't sure if we could pull it off. Now that we did though, I feel very confident that we can do more and do better, so it’s kind of exciting to see what we can do in the future.

**\-- Among the new songs for this tour,** **_Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_** **(SKKK),** **_Sugao de KISS ME_****,** **_Chikatetsu Labyrinth_****, and** **_Platinum Sunrise_****, which of these were you the most excited to perform?**  

TM: It would have to be _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_. I was fortunate enough to see fan reactions for myself when the song was first revealed at the initial screening of _Shadow of Youth_ (_Seishun no Kage_). (laughs) I was watching from the sidelines, giggling as they go, "Uwaa!" when Hayasaka-san’s scene came on.  

**\-- How about _Platinum Sunrise_, since it’s the first _Wake Up, Girls!_ duet song?**

\[In contrast to _Aa Hikarizuka Kagekidan_ (the Yoppi and Mayu duet), sung in first live, which was an anime-based song.\]

TM: I sing with Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) a lot—in WUG Radio, in private, and karaoke. So when talks of making songs which didn't involve all the members came up, I immediately thought if it were possible to do one with her. _Platinum Sunrise_ is a vocal-heavy song where Yoppi gets to show off her choral skill.  

**\-- The song's focus on keeping a flowing harmony does make it unique, compared to SKKK that alternates between high points and low points.**  

TM: Right. It's a good way to challenge ourselves as we try new ideas and show off how much we've improved since the last tour.  

**\-- It seems like you get to be the lead vocal in a lot of songs.**  

TM: I'm not used to harmonizing. If anything, my voice tends to overpower others.  

**\-- It really stands out.**

TM: It kinda does. (laughs) My voice can be easy to pick out.

**\-- But isn't it tough to sync and stick to choreography while powering through as the main vocal?**  

TM: I've gotten used to it because I always get this role and I have a feeling the others are doing their best to match up with me.  

**\-- Like in SKKK with Yoshioka-san (Yoshioka Mayu) and Aoyama-san as head tones and Okuno-san as the bass tone?**  

TM: Exactly! It's always impressive watching them whenever we record.  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c002.jpg)

**\-- I think SKKK's arrangement is quite interesting. Yoshioka-san has more singing parts while Aoyama-san is more on harmony, and you and Yamashita-san (Yamashita Nanami) are more prominent.**  

TM: It doesn't feel like our usual songs. I've always wanted to pair with (Okuno) Kaya since last year's [projection mapping event](https://ameblo.jp/wakeupgirls/entry-11948603863.html). She even suggested if we could do that.  

**\-- Ah. So even before _Platinum Sunrise_****, you already had experience doing duets in projection mapping events in Kesennuma and STUDIO ALTA.**  

TM: We paired up in both. Actually, in Kesennuma, one of the Avex staff helping us injured their hand with a pair of scissors. I remember being rattled when it happened but Kaya, in her usual way, helped out instead, all the while commenting on how pretty the color of their blood was. (laughs) I’m very grateful that there are fans coming to see us even in those faraway places.  

**\-- Now that the tour has wrapped up, can you tell me your impressions?**  

TM: It's surprising how hectic things get at every show that I almost fail to realize how quickly time passes. Luckily, I had quite a bit of time to mess around during the character song sections because I’m the last. Now that I think about it, we try to think of good moves for our character songs, but backstage we tend to compete and invent the weirdest dance steps while we waited for our turn. Airi’s really good at that and I get swept into her energy. That's how it usually went for those sections.

**\-- That's unexpected to hear that Eino-san goofs around by making up weird dance routines.**  

TM: She gets really pumped up whenever we do shows. She told me before she can’t help but feel that way whenever she gets a chance to dance because she's been dancing for a long time.  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c004.jpg)

**\-- Can you share a standout experience during one of the shows?**  

TM: It would be _Platinum Sunrise_ at our final show in Sendai. If you compare it to our afternoon show in Osaka, that was the best performance we did and I felt like we finally did it justice and harmonized properly.  

**\-- How does it compare to Osaka?**  

TM: We always messed up that song at every time. Either we fail to sync up, or forget the lyrics, or some other reason. And after that part, we go straight to character songs. At first, I didn’t even know how to position myself but we finally synced up perfectly in Sendai, and I felt like we did what we visualized. The audience seemed to enjoy it a lot and I was happy that our last performance ended up being the best. When we finished, Yoppi came up to me and said the same thing and we gave each other a double high five. We both felt like we achieved something!

**\-- Can you tell me about Katayama Minami and how you see her now?**  

TM: Her adorable and innocent nature hasn't changed at all and I mean that in a good way. She's a ray of positive energy that really brings up the mood of the group. She always thoughtful of others, and she loves to sing as much as everyone else. She's one of the youngest but she's strong, and I’ve always thought of her as a wonderful person.  

**\-- She's the cutesy and clingy contrast to Kaya's strict nature.**  

TM: The group would feel very awkward without her  

**\-- Not to mention her catchphrase, "Unmenya~"**  

TM: I’d like to say it's thanks to that catchphrase that more people got to know about WUG, and come to our shows.  

**\-- Speaking of Minami-chan's unchanging nature, did anything about you change since then?**  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c007.jpg)

TM: When we were starting out, I was someone who was very picky and didn’t feel like having to do more than I should, which of course, made me somewhat of a troublemaker. But I eventually wanted to shape up and be more responsible because I realized that if I didn’t, not only would I cause trouble for the members but other people as well. Then somehow people suddenly started praising me on how grown-up I was.  

**\-- Could it be because you're an older sister?**  

TM: Probably, or maybe because I like to take care of others.  

**\-- What were you aiming to become when you auditioned for WUG?**  

TM: I couldn’t imagine myself as anything but a voice actress when I first learned of it as a career so I did things to pursue it. I joined the theater club in middle school and was part of the radio broadcasting club in high school. At career counseling with my parents, I told them I wanted to enroll at a voice acting academy, which got me scolded. They told me to take it seriously, but I did, so I looked for an audition as a way to convince them. I considered other options like training but I was feeling impatient so I looked for ways that could get me started as soon as possible, and that's when I found the WUG audition \[as a banner ad at Niconico\]. It involved playing a role in an anime and a lot of singing so I decided to apply.  

\[By some stroke of chance, she became president of both the theater club (she was the only one in her circle who didn't go to cram school so they recommended her to their advisor) and the broadcasting club (the only two seniors of the club were the student council president and vice-president)  
  
On several occasions, she would confidently state that no matter what, she would eventually become a voice actress. If she didn't get selected for WUG, she'd enroll in a voice acting academy or find some other way to get into the industry. She never considered going to college at all, partially because she didn’t consider herself good at school, especially math and english (except European history, where she got high marks, according to her second photobook). Because of this, she feels that she has to mature earlier than her school friends, who went to college at the time, stating that she has take her job seriously because it was what she wanted. That said, Mayu would sometimes bring her along to have lunch at her university cafeteria and she would comment about take in the academic atmosphere.  
  
Regardless of how she would become a voice actress, she is grateful for WUG because she wouldn't be who she is without it, and she is very thankful for having parents who were supportive every step of the way right from the start. They even provided her dress when she accepted her award for Best Newcomer at the 2017 Seiyuu Awards.\]

**\-- What made you realize that being a voice actress would be the only career choice for you?**  

TM: I've always been a fan of anime and, at the time, I learned the various ways voice actresses can utilize their voice, from mature ladies to young boys. It was so cool it got me interested in trying it, which lead me to acting. I joined the theater club in middle school and I got to star as the lead in a play. It was my first time but I found it really enjoyable to perform in front of an audience. So I thought, “If my love for anime lead me to acting, the only thing left for me to do is pursue voice acting!”

**\-- Do you have an actor or actress that you look up to?**  

TM: I look up to Kugimiya Rie. She voices a young boy character \[Taiki\] in The Twelve Kingdoms, a really cute female character named Louise in Familiar of Zero, and even an altogether different yet interesting character \[Kagura\] in Gintama. She has such an impressive range.

**\-- Have you achieved the goals you set for yourself now that you’re a voice actress?**  

TM: It’s a dream for me that I'm able to stand side-by-side, script in hand, next to voice actors that I look up to. I always feel conscious of that fact whenever I work with them and I can’t help but run out and shout for joy once the recording session is over, even if it’ll get me weird looks. (laughs) I’m so glad I became a voice actress. Even now when I’ve achieved some of my dreams, little by little, I aim to achieve more.  

**\-- Have you managed to get some of the roles you’ve been hoping to portray?**  

TM: I’ve done a lot of energetic characters and I’ve done all sorts of roles for social games. So now I want to try something different like boy characters or cool and expressionless types. I want to surprise everyone with the kinds of characters I can portray.  

**\-- The other day, you get to perform for the second time in Saitama Super Arena for _Animelo Summer Live 2015 - THE GATE -_ (Anisama). I want to ask about the mic incident last year, where the sound was cutting off. I imagine that had to be very unsettling.**  

TM: The first thing that came to my mind at the time was, “Oh, my mic’s acting up! Well… This is gonna end up in the blu-ray and I should be on the big screen right about now!”. That and I have to sing well regardless of whether they hear me or not.  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c010.jpg)

**\-- Sounds like you adapted pretty quickly.**  

TM: I was worried at first because of the blu-ray. (laughs) I wasn’t even sure if it showed on my face but I had to keep smiling, hope that my mic hangs in there, dance as best I can, and it was over before I knew it. You could barely hear me in _7 Girls War_ but people told me they could hear me well in _Tachiagare_, but I’m not sure since Miyu covered for my solos.  

\[Even now, Miyu would take over parts when needed. Yoppi’s parts in _7GW_ and _Tachiagare_ in events she couldn’t attend, and Mayu’s _Polaris_ solo in 2018's Anime Rave Festival Volume 3\]

**\-- When the set was over, you seemed upset and the members were worried.**  

TM: I think Yoppi worried the most. When we finished this year, she was in tears, feeling so happy for me. (laughs) I was like, “Why are you crying?”, which got me crying. I think all this time she took it upon herself as our leader to worry about things like that.    

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c009.jpg)

**\-- I’m sure this second Anisama meant different things for each of the members but how was it for you?**  

TM: Surprisingly, I didn’t feel all that nervous. I guess it’s because I performed the previous day as part of Class 3-E for _Assassination Classroom_ so I got acclimated to that environment once again. I still felt nervous but no more than I should and it was the good kind of nervousness. If anything, I felt more at ease the more the crowd got excited.  

**\-- You also got to perform with experienced voice actresses such as Fuchigami Mai and Suzaki Aya.**  

TM: Yes! I felt that I could leave it to them to hype up the crowd so I get enjoy the moment with everyone. The whole experience was great.  

**\-- Were you able to carry that momentum for your WUG performance?**  

TM: Yeah. That would make it my third time performing so I didn’t feel tense when I came in as WUG. Unlike last year, we were surrounded by the audience on center stage and we could see them up close but performing felt natural. I think I owe our tour experience for that. Even SKKK didn’t faze me.  

**\-- You even shouted, “Can you hear me?” during your MC segment.**  

TM: Honestly, I couldn’t think of anything to say. Miyu already said, “Let’s have fun!” so I had to think of something else, and I’m the type who just wings it for those portions.  

**\-- Do you feel like it’s better to play it by ear when you’re in the moment?**  

TM: Something like that. I tend to sound stiff and rehearsed when I overthink things. So when I shouted, I simply thought of what I wanted to tell everyone and I was glad to hear them respond so loudly.  

**\-- What do you think of your performance this year, in general?**  

TM: It’s a totally different feeling when you’re rehearsing for Anisama compared to actually performing with the audience. You worry if people even know who you are, then you realize some of them wearing WUG happis, see the whole arena lighting up with your color, hear them call out your name, then all your worries go away just like that and you stop feeling tense.  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c006.jpg)

**\-- How was it performing on the center stage?**  

TM: I thought it was a dream come true getting to walk to the center stage while waving at the audience because we were only on the main stage last year. When it came to the actual performance, though, all I could think of was rushing so we could get into position. We underestimated the amount of time we had when we rehearsed. That said, it was an experience being able to perform in the middle of that sea of green lights.  

**\-- I imagine your fans envisioned it like in the anime since the I-1 arena was modeled after the Saitama Super Arena.**  

TM: It’s a perfect copy inside and out! I’m sure those who are familiar with the place were surprised as well. It had the same entrance the girls used, the same vending machine where President Tange and Matsuda-san had their conversation, even our dressing room looked the same! I actually ended up watching that episode again afterward. Now, I can’t help but think how significant the arena is for WUG.

\[According to Koji Saito (Saito P), Anisama's general producer, they actually asked for permission to film and take reference photos of the venue, and they even supplied them with CG data for the stage setup. When they did SKKK for Anisama, they tried replicating the camera shots from the movie for the blu-ray release.\]

**\-- What do you think about the finale?**  

TM: That was so fun. We only got to sing one line last year but we got three this time, and they were good lines, too. We ended up drawing lots so we don’t have to decide who gets to sing. Yoppi, Miyu, and I, the Three Otaku Musketeers, got lucky.  

**\-- There were a lot of distinguished artists with you, as well.**  

TM: Yeah! The highlight for me was that we got to sing with Kalafina! Just the thought of it got me so excited.  

![](/images/sp-1509242000-c011.jpg)

**\-- It seemed that there was a bit of a commotion happening when the three of you at the front were passing the mic to Eino-san.**  

TM: We were actually trying to hand off the mic to the others at the back but we didn't plan on it originally so they insisted otherwise and somehow, Aichan got moved to the front. (laughs)  

**\-- Looking back to the tour, I feel like you seem more emotional. Like you're showing more expressions, tears even.**  

TM: Really? I think it's because I've been feeling more attached to WUG lately. It's become something important to me and thinking about how we'll grow and develop has made me emotional, even to the point of crying. Lately though, those have been tears of joy instead of frustration, which I think is good.  

**\-- Do you think it's because of the sequel movies coming out?**  

TM: I guess so! The girls are in Tokyo again, and ready to take on the biggest stage in I-1 Arena in much the same way we did in Anisama. I'm sure we'll get to see the inside of that again as well.  

**\-- Can you tell me anything we should watch out for in _Shadow of Youth_****?**  

TM: You will see different sides of the girls in this movie. From their enthusiasm as they make a new start in Tokyo, to their frustration as they struggle to face hardships. But through it all, they will never give up and they will keep pressing on in the scruffy way WUG does so I hope everyone gives them their support. There's also a new and important character named Carlos Kamoda, and we’re all excited to see how that goes. (laughs)  

**\-- Finally, a word about the upcoming movie to your fans, old and new.**  

TM: The release of our long-awaited movie _Shadow of Youth_ is around the corner. It's a new story that will deepen the bonds between the girls. Of course, there will be barriers and hardships but they will never give in and hopefully, you'll be with us in supporting them. Come watch it. I'm sure there are those who have just known about us through Anisama, and there are those who have been supporting us since the start. Don’t forget about the movies coming out in September and December \[Beyond the Bottom\], which would hopefully bring us to a new start next year!
