This feature interview was originally published to promote a series of middle-school grade Japanese and English reference material that features Toyama Nao’s voice (Product links with a somewhat similar voice sample at the end). Hence, this is meant for a middle-school audience but incidentally, it also touches on her middle school and high school experiences, and her relationship with studying and the English language.

**Excelling in High School to Achieve My Voice Acting Dream**

* * *

I was a hopeless student in middle school. I remember having taken my middle school entrance exam and, everyone, including my cram school teachers and parents, wasn’t sure if I could pass. I did by some stroke of luck but the school I enrolled in wasn’t a good fit for me and no matter how hard I tried my grades never improved. I couldn’t understand the lectures at all and my test scores were getting worse.

It was only during high school that I started taking my studies diligently because by then I was taking voice acting lessons and my parents told me that they’d let me be a voice actress if I go to college. My school was considered the best out there and my grade had lots of smart students. While I couldn’t hope to catch up to them right away, my desire to be a voice actress became a strong driving force for me to do better and my grades improved as a result.

**English, My Favorite Subject**

* * *

I enjoy learning how to sing and dance as it is necessary for my work. But when it comes to school subjects, especially those that require tons of memorization, not so much. English was the only one I liked.

I didn’t come from your usual family household. My dad is a returnee and my mom is an English major so I had a peculiar childhood that exposed me to both English and Japanese. I also had pleasant experiences with English through my ECC and Eurhythmics classes so it wasn’t hard for me to pick it up when I actually started learning it in middle school. I wouldn’t necessarily say I was good at it, though, since my test scores weren’t didn’t reflect that so it's my belief that even if English isn’t your strong suit, it’s never too late to give it a serious shot. 

**Difficulty With Vague Subjects**

* * *

In some ways, I disliked studying Japanese, especially contemporary works, which I found difficult because there’s never an undeniably right answer. I’m not as bad with the classics and writing kanji, but my reading comprehension wasn’t great so I didn’t do too well with questions that required me to read into a character or writer’s feelings and motivations. I’d encounter questions like “What was Child A feeling here?” or “Kindly write the author’s intention with this piece” and grumble about not having enough space to write the answer.

I had an easier time with Math since there can only be one answer. But I didn’t enjoy memorizing and there were so many formulas that I knew I wasn’t going to do well in it. I remember Science and Social Studies being those subjects that reward you for simply putting in the work. I came to like those subjects because my teachers were excellent. My Social Studies teacher in particular had a way of teaching that involved weaving a dramatic narrative based on events and the people in it, which made it enjoyable.  

**Results Matter**

* * *

I used to goof off during all-nighters. The greatest danger when you cram for exams is getting stuck in a rut. I used to reorganize and create my own English flash card decks, rewrite my notebooks, and do things that made me feel satisfied that I did something even though I didn’t actually study anything. That was why my grades didn’t improve in the first place. What’s important when you hit the books is to make sure you fully understand the study material so you shouldn’t take too long organizing your stuff.

I have a personal motto that I learned through all that studying: “Effort without result is merely an excuse.” They're words that I live by. It sounds strict but once you internalize it, you’ll think of ways to produce results instead of getting sidetracked. 

**Change Your Approach When it Doesn’t Work**

* * *

I studied because I wanted to achieve my dream. Without a proper motivation, it would have been so hard to do. Of course, I imagine it’s hard to keep yourself motivated in middle school because you’d think that you won’t even touch concepts like sine, cosine, and tangent once you graduate. But the experience itself of putting in the effort will stick with you and build your confidence for the real world. That’s what’s important here, not necessarily what you studied.

I’m sure some of the readers of this book have been struggling with the same mental block—”I’m trying so hard but it’s not working,” “My test scores aren’t improving at all.” For those, just remember my motto “Effort without result is merely an excuse.” What you’ve been doing so far probably isn’t working for you. Once you rethink your approach and try another, you’ll see improvements right away. So I encourage those who have trouble studying to keep at it.

**Aiming For Certifications During Middle School**

* * *

My school heavily encouraged us to get certifications through proficiency tests and in high school I managed to pass Eiken Grade 1, Kanken Grade 2, and Suken Grade 2. \[Eiken, Kanken, Suken are national proficiency tests for English, Kanji, and Mathematics, respectively.\]

I lucked out with Eiken, to be honest. I bought two Eiken Grade 1 flashcard decks which contained words that you won't even find in college prep classes. I managed to memorize all of them then immediately forgot half of it once I got to the first question of the actual test. So I just circled my pencil over the choices, went with my gut, and got 10 of 15 answers correct. (laughs) The spoken section had its own difficulties as well but I was smiling when it wrapped up. 

**Relate Middle School Lessons to Work**

* * *

I voiced Karen Kujo in _Kin-iro Mosaic_ which involved a lot of English dialogue that had to be pronounced in English. My dad speaks American English so grasping the peculiarities of British English was a challenge though I got better at it with each take so it was a good experience.

I occasionally get to use my English knowledge for work but Japanese tends to come up the most. Likewise, Biology and Social Science also gets used in everyday conversation so what I learned back then is still useful to me now. 

I can still recall a lot of the stuff I’ve learned in middle school. When we had our second year math finals, our teacher got very upset at us because the we got a low average score. It turned out that the questions were kind you find in Todai (University of Tokyo) entrance exams. I thought the they were absurdly difficult then our teacher said this:

“The point that I want you all to remember is that this wasn’t meant to torment you. It’s for you to realize that you can solve these questions with what you already know; your studies right now will find its way into bigger things down the road. That mastering them will make you capable of tackling questions even from Todai.” 

For middle schoolers, college entrance exams feel like something so far in the future but you're learning things right then and there that are actually relevant. You’ve yet to experience what I’ve already gone through but I feel that what my teacher said says a lot about how important studying is.

**Answer College Admission Exam Questions Even Now**

* * *

I’ve stopped recently, I used to listen to English news podcasts. I also took English lessons for _Kin-iro Mosaic_ with Tanaka Manami \[who voiced Alice Cartelet\]. Those lessons were designed for English teachers and our instructor, who speaks native English, often joked around and did small talk with everyone, which left all of us grasping for words. (laughs)

I know this is still a long way off for middle school but lately I’ve been interested in the questions testing centers use for college admissions. Some get published every year so I’m curious to see if I could answer them. I’ve taken the test myself so I know how balanced it is, with questions that diligent students can answer as well as questions that takes some thinking to get through. World history is something you forget as you grow up but English has a way of sticking with you forever like riding a bicycle would. So I’ve been thinking if I could at least give the English section a shot when I have time between work.

**Keep Studying, Even if You Don’t Like it**

* * *

Much of my younger years revolved around studying so you might think that the takeaway here is to be diligent in doing it, but what I want to impart is to enjoy your youth as well. That’s just as important.

You’ll get into studying once you find that one subject that you like but it’s fine if you don’t. I don’t like studying as well but I kept at it, found a style that worked for me, and started improving. If you’re having trouble, don’t lose heart and find a way that works for you.
