**Pursuing dreams and achieving them, one at a time. Kusunoki Tomori, untapped potential at 20.**

![](/images/1 (2).jpg)

This interview was published to coincide with the release of Kusunoki Tomori’s (楠木ともり) debut single _Hamidashimono_ (ハミダシモノ). It tackles a wide range of topics, from her childhood, her audition, the challenges she faced starting out, the songs in the single, and her song making process. There’s also a lightning round of trivia at the end.

**Adamantly Righteous and Determined. Student Council President in Middle School.**

* * *

**— Let’s start this interview by asking what kind of kid you were growing up.**

**Kusunoki Tomori (KT):** According to my parents, I was a righteous kid and adamantly so. I remember not getting along with kids who like to play pranks; I always got mad and never let them get away with it. I was pretty active in school because I love participating in events.

**— Did you do well in academics or sports?**

**KT:** I did well in my studies up until around middle school, enough to get some recognition from my teachers. (laughs) I was hopeless at sports, so much that I dreaded taking PE classes.

**— I heard that you started taking piano lessons at the age of 3. Who did you dream of becoming back then?**

**KT:** There wasn’t really anything in particular but I used to take art classes and my parents entertained the thought of me becoming an illustrator. I enjoyed music, especially singing and listening to it, but playing the piano… not so much. (laughs)

**— (laughs) Kids usually get tired of taking piano lessons.**

**KT:** That’s it! (laughs) I really didn’t enjoy it because my fingers were short and I couldn’t reach the keys. I preferred drawing more.

**— Did things change in middle school?**

**KT:** I stopped taking those classes except for English by the time I hit middle school. You could say that my studies shifted from there. My personality stayed the same, still a go-getter at class. I even became student council president.

I didn’t make many friends, though. Back in grade school, I thought that holding a role that puts you in front and in charge of people is something to be proud of. But I guess I became a little self-conscious in middle school and I avoided standing out as much as I could. (laughs) 

**—** **What kind of things happened that made it difficult for you to make friends?**

**KT:** It’s probably a bit too much to say I got bullied… but basically they did things just to get under my skin. They would hide my stuff and I knew they were saying things behind my back. It discouraged me from being in front of people because I thought that was the reason.

**— Then how did you become student council president?**

**KT:** My teacher approached me about it. I was already the secretary of the student council the previous year so continuing on and becoming president wasn’t out of the question.

**— Yet despite your aversion to standing out, it seems that you persevered in your duties for the entire term.**

**KT:** I did. I was determined and I would have regretted making compromises for myself. (laughs) It’s not as though I made a mistake, since the faculty backed me up and I didn’t want to disappoint them. And once I set my mind to something, I had to see it through.

We held a chorus recital right before our graduation ceremony, and I was technically “in-charge” of the brass band since I was the one who could read sheet music. Someone finally thanked me there, and because of that I felt very fulfilled when I graduated.

**_I found anime, and it pulled me through my rut._**

* * *

![](/images/3 (2).jpg)

**— Did your middle school friends get you into anime?**

**KT:** I have a sister, who is 5 years older than me, and my interests and the things I did at the time came mostly from her. Despite our age gap, we went to the same schools, where she also served as student council president.

One time, my relatives told me that a lot of her rubbed off on me. They probably didn’t mean anything by it but I took it as though they meant to say that I was a blank slate without a mind of my own. It bothered me because I did enjoy those things myself yet people just saw me as following in her footsteps.

So I spent a lot of time looking for what’s undoubtedly “mine” and it was anime. It wasn’t much but I felt like I finally found myself. But I didn’t just latch on to it immediately, rather I eased myself into liking it. 

**— Are there any memorable ones in particular?**

**KT:** There’s _Tokyo Mew Mew_. I was 2 when it first aired, and my only vivid memory of it was the opening. Then my mom eventually showed me a video of it just to see if I still remembered, and it all came flooding back, which prompted me to rewatch the series.

Another is _Kobato_. I watched reruns of it and what captivated me was Hanazawa Kana’s adorable voice and confident performance. This sparked my love of anime and eventually my interest in voice acting as a career, so you could say that these two works were instrumental in deciding the trajectory of my life. I found anime when my frustration had reached its peak, and it was anime that pulled me through it.

**— What did you do to prepare yourself for voice acting?**

**KT:** It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. My friend, who would recommend anime to me, also wanted to be a voice actor. We would look for 5-minute scripts, since you can easily find those online, picked ones we like, printed them out, got together after class, and made sure no one was around as we read them aloud on the way home. (laughs) We’d laugh at each other because it’s kind of embarrassing to do...

\[She is referring to フリー台本 (_furī daihon_)**—**scripts that are freely shared online, usually by hobbyists, with light restrictions when it comes to use, sharing, and copyright. They’re generally short and are used for practice. Some are even shared online with voice and visual effects done by others, which is encouraged by some writers as they don’t have the resources to do so.

**— That’s a pretty whimsical way of going about it.**

**KT:** Indeed! I had so much fun doing them.

**Having The Best Time in High School Among Friends.**

* * *

![](/images/4 (1).jpg)

**— What did you do in high school?**

**KT:** I got fed up having to second guess my friends in middle school so I concentrated on my exams. And in high school, I was completely free from taking roles that’d get me special attention. (laughs) Many of my schoolmates felt the same way I did about it, and there wasn’t anyone who would say mean things about those who do stand out.

I was part of the light music club, and people watched our shows and cheered us on. I had the time of my life with my friends, and that’s when I let myself go and tried all sorts of things.

**— What instrument did you play?**

**KT:** I was basically the vocalist, but I played the keyboard a few times. We only played anisong and vocaloid covers, which wasn’t fun on the keyboard. (laughs) I found it impossible to do while singing, so at some point an amazing keyboardist joined to help us out.

**— And throughout that time, your desire to get into voice acting didn’t change?**

**KT:** If anything, I wanted to do it even more. I had no idea how to make it happen but I made it my goal to debut while in high school. And even if I didn’t achieve it, I figured I should re-focus my efforts toward it, so much that I even told my parents about my intention.

**— How did they react?**

**KT:** Well, they were on the fence about it, so to speak. (laughs) My parents were hoping that I get a stable job, so while they did support my decision, they first wanted me to do well in school and graduate. That left me to learn things on my own as much as I could.

Still, they didn’t outright reject it. They even encouraged me to give it a shot and searched for audition materials for me. Despite their concern, they let me do what I wanted.

**— How supportive of them!**

**KT:** They even watched anime I liked. My parents really wanted to see where I was coming from.

**— How about your friends?**

**KT:** My friend from middle school, the one who wanted to get into voice acting, had moved far away so we couldn’t see each other at all during high school. Now that I’ve started working, though, we’ve been getting in touch again.

My high school friends didn’t even bat an eye, and encouraged me. They were like, “I’m expecting an autograph when you get famous!” (laughs) 

**— I imagine they’re confident because they know you’re a great singer with a nice voice.**

**KT:** Hmm, maybe. They always liked my singing but they hadn’t heard me voice act, so they’re probably just being kind. (laughs) So much that they’d even pray for someone else’s success.

The final stage of my audition (Sony Music Artists’ _Anistoteles_ Audition) was open to a live audience, and they came to watch and support me. And the day before that, they gave me an album which contained cards with messages written on it. It was so touching!

![](/images/5 (1).jpg)

**Coming Out on Top of the Audition with Mixed Feelings.**

* * *

**— Let’s talk about your audition. Apparently, you entered that audition aiming to be a singer instead of a voice actress.**

**KT:** There was an event before this audition, where the winner gets to voice a TV commercial, and I didn’t even get past the preliminary stage. It was totally disheartening because it made me reconsider my chances as someone who doesn’t even have acting experience.

But I wanted to be involved in anime and it hit me if I could approach it as a singer instead, so I gave that an honest shot for _Anistoteles_. That said, in my interview, I did voice my intention to be a voice actress.

**— How was the screening process?**

**KT:** You pick a program and they hand you a theme, which consists of a video of an existing work. I practiced using that as a guide while making sure I wasn’t copying the delivery. Mine was from the _Monogatari_ series and it was an emotional scene by Sengoku Nadeko, who is voiced by Hanazawa Kana.

**— Since singing ability was also evaluated, how did you prepare for it?**

**KT:** My bandmate in the light music club was an amazing singer, and I owe her so much. We went to karaoke and she just listened to me sing the entire time, all the while giving pointers like singing a certain way at certain points, or using a falsetto when I’m having trouble. That’s how we spent our free time and it was more than I could ask for.

**— That sounds like something a producer would do!**

KT: Exactly! I’m totally in her debt. I probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for her. She’s a great friend and we’re still close even today.

**— How did the audition proper go?**

**KT:** You first get called by the agency, in groups of about 10 or 20 applicants, into a conference room quite like… I think it’s this very room actually. (laughs) There were also around 20 people from Sony, who served as judges, so you’re practically surrounded by 40 or so people as you perform.

**— That has to be nerve-racking!**

**KT:** It was terrifying. I’m a sore loser, though, so I saw every single hopeful in that room as my rival and that fired me up. I kept telling myself that I’ll come out on top no matter what so I wouldn’t get overwhelmed.

I proceeded through the second screening all by myself because our school was holding a festival that day. So I had to tell my teachers about it before heading out. I think I was the very last applicant because I didn’t run into anyone else. 

**— Then you got past that to reach the final stage, where a panel of judges, as well as your friends, watched you perform.**

**KT:** Tada Mitsuhiro was the piano accompaniment for my entry piece and it feels like fate that it all started from there, knowing that he’s my voice coach now and I’ve performed with him in concerts and such.

I was very nervous during the performance itself. I barely remember anything. I’ve only entered two auditions in my life and now that I think about it, I can’t believe how I endured them. (laughs) I was probably more resilient back then because I wouldn’t be able to deal with it now.

**— So how did you feel when you learned that you passed?**

**KT:** It was going to be announced in front of the audience and, of course, I was aiming for the grand prize. Before that came, though, my name was called to receive the special prize, and I was completely at a loss as to what to feel—I was both happy that I won, and confused because it wasn’t the grand prize. I cried and I couldn’t tell if it’s from joy or sadness. I was thrown for a loop. I couldn’t just say I’m over the moon because it also felt painful. 

**— You really wanted it. But did you even expect that your name would come up at all?**

**KT:** I wasn’t necessarily confident about it. But having gotten that far, I didn’t want to come out empty-handed. My parents were there too, so it would be embarrassing if I wasn’t called at all.

**— And in the end, you got the special prize.**

**KT:** My friends were overjoyed… though I felt dejected since I didn’t get the grand prize. (laughs) At the time, I had no idea if I’d get signed by the agency for winning it, so part of me thought it was just a generous consolation. (laughs)

**— When did you feel happy about it?**

**KT:** The day after the audition. I entered my classroom, and there were a bunch of gifts stacked high on my desk.

**— Your friends did that?! Wow!!**

**KT:** It still makes me tear up just thinking about it. I was so happy that my friends congratulated me. It really hit me that I’ve made great friends, and even now they come to my shows and send me good vibes about my work even though I don’t mention any of it. I’m really grateful to them.

**A Sudden Lead Role and A Wavering Resolve.**

* * *

![](/images/6 (1).jpg)

**— Let’s talk about the time after you signed with your agency. It’s surprising that your first studio audition led to you voicing the protagonist of** **_Märchen Mädchen_****. I’m curious to know what went through your head back then.**

**KT:** My agency didn’t have lecturers at the time, so I learned by watching more seasoned professionals. I would ask if they could send me a recording of their performances, though there was no guarantee of getting anything.

So when we recorded my voice for _Märchen Mädchen_, I finally got a bit of validation when my manager liked it for the first time. Then a few days later we got a call from the studio and you can imagine how shocked I was. (laughs)

**— So you didn’t know that your manager submitted the tape.**

**KT:** Yeah. That’s how I learned that studio auditions actually existed and I had no idea what they were. (laughs) That’s also when it dawned on me that the industry is made up of all sorts of people.

In a recording booth, there are 4 microphones set at various heights, and you actually have to get in there, find one that matches your height, and let the staff do the fine adjustments for you. That time, though, I thought I could do it myself and ended up knocking the mic over… which got me a fine scolding instead. (laughs) I thought I really messed up there, which managed to calm me down somewhat.

**— And now, three years into it, you’ve gained quite a lot of experience. You’re the lead of** **_Sword Art Online Alternative Gun Gale Online_****, and performed as a member of** **_Nijigasaki High School Idol Club_****. Looking back, have you encountered moments that brought you down?**

**KT:** It’s a constant feeling, actually. I feel self-conscious by the fact that I’m self-taught. I never had any formal training so I don’t know if I’m doing it right. If anything, I started out oblivious of my own abilities, unaware if I’m any good or not.

In my first recording, I was frantically trying to keep up with the pace of dialogue instead of acting. I was convinced that when it airs, everyone would notice the parts where I messed up, and I’d get all sorts of harsh criticism. It really brought me down. I was at the end of my wits, feeling like I wasn’t really good at all.

**— How did you overcome it?**

**KT:** Well… To be honest, I couldn’t manage to get over it. It’s like I was hoping it’ll work itself out eventually. And when I consult my friends and family about it, they tell me to try not to let it get to me.

**— That sounds good but then again, once next week rolls around, another round of recordings and broadcasts will follow.**

**KT:** That’s it. I agonized over it the entire time, wondering how much longer I had to feel like I’m just waiting for the show to broadcast, all the while knowing how bad I really was.

_Märchen Mädchen_ primarily had a female cast so I had a lot of “mentors” to learn from. Whenever they’re on the mic, I absorb everything they do and try to figure things out like the kind of voice they project, or even where they look when it’s not on the script.

**— And from there you steadily managed to find your footing?**

**KT:** Not really. (laughs) To be honest, I just felt my way through it and did the best I could.

_Gun Gale Online_, though, had a wonderful cast who were kind enough to answer my ridiculous inquiries. When it aired, people liked my voice and my acting a lot, and I finally gained some peace of mind. It became a little easier since it felt as though people had finally gotten used to hearing me. It’s like being liberated from my chains and I started to enjoy acting again.

**— Did your fellow castmates say something that stuck with you?**

**KT:** Okitsu (Kazuyuki)-san, who voiced M, was always there to give sensible advice that a novice like me could easily understand. Things like “If you read it this way, it’ll sound like this.” 

But his biggest advice came when I kept asking if I was matching my performance with theirs. He told me, “You’re the lead cast member. You’re the one who sets the tone, so there’s no such thing as right or wrong. Just relax.” Truly profound words. I realized that I didn’t need to know what I should do. I could just be myself. And I sensed that the rest of the veteran cast allowed me to perform freely as they adjusted their performance to suit the anime.

**It Began with “I want ice cream.”— The Unsung Origins of** **_Nagame no Sora_** **(眺めの空)**

* * *

**— Now, I’d like to ask about your musical endeavors. With the release of the single** **_Hamidashimono_** **(ハミダシモノ) on August 19, finally marking your major debut as an artist, I’d like to know what you felt when you first heard about it.**

![](/images/7 (1).jpg)

**KT:** I thought my manager was kidding, like pulling a prank. (laughs) And it was a tie-up (Ending song for _The Misfit of Demon King Academy_, which she also voices in) so I could hardly believe that I’d be involved with a great production like that right from the start.

I was also just starting out as a voice actress at the time and I mused what a pipe dream it would be to debut as an artist at 20, so it was truly like a dream come true.

**— Did you consult your team as to the kind of music you wanted to produce?**

**KT:** Personally, I don’t really listen to upbeat music. I often turn to music when I feel down, but I get annoyed if the song’s too lively and high-spirited, where all it wants to say is “You can do it!”. (laughs) I’d rather listen to something melancholic that empathizes with the troubles I’m going through. So in that sense, I wanted to make music that’s relatable.

Another reason is that I’ve written songs that try to calm you by taking those everyday anxieties and releasing them in a cathartic way. I thought it would be great to create songs that appeal to the heart and hopefully brighten up someone’s day.

**— I listened to the songs you previously made that were released on Youtube and I’m impressed by their level of quality! When did you start writing and composing songs?**

**KT:** I dabbled in songmaking when my high school’s light music club was playing original music, but my first real attempt was the coupling track for this release, _Nagame no Sora_.

https://youtu.be/Hjnx2\_ejF5Y

**— I see! I honestly found it unbelievable that it was this good for a first attempt. (laughs)** 

**KT:** (laughs) I’ve only sung covers in Tada-san’s acoustic shows. So when I approached him about making a song, he told me to give it a shot, so I started on it and sent it over to him, all within that same day.

**\--Wow! What was your process?** 

**KT:** I hum. (laughs) I started by writing the lyrics and then humming the melody. I used to take piano lessons so I transcribed the melody into sheet music, presented it to Tada-san, and begged him to do the arrangement and add chords to it.

**— Did you also give him an idea of the arrangement?**

**KT:** Tada-san built the framework, then we proceeded to work on it together. I provided input as to what major chord to use at certain sections, or which chords I wanted changed in order to match the rhythm with the lyrics, and such. From there, he knew exactly what I wanted and the chords came out really well.

**— What’s your working environment when you write lyrics?**

**KT:** It doesn’t have to be anything specific as long as it’s quiet, which happens to be my room. I have my phone ready to jot down lyrics and record my humming for the melody as I aimlessly scatter about. (laughs)

For _Nagame no Sora_, I was browsing through the works of my favorite photographer and… To tell you the truth, I was eating ice cream at the time. (laughs)

**— That’s not how I expected the process to be, given the tone of the song. (laughs)**

**KT:** Well, I wanted to write a song about ice cream. And surprisingly enough, some of my best work came out of that craving. (laughs) That’s why “ice cream” shows up in the lyrics.

**— How did Tada-san like the song when you first showed it to him?**

**KT:** Initially, he didn’t expect that I’d send it to him so soon. (laughs) I never studied how chords worked so the melody was pretty out there, but he was impressed by how unique and catchy it was, especially for my first try.

**_I want everyone to wonder who “You” and “I” are._**

* * *

**— Now, I’d like to ask about the title song** **_Hamidashimono_****, which is composed by Shigenaga Ryōsuke. How was the theme of the lyrics decided?**

https://youtu.be/F0A86w3mdRY

**KT:** I thought about the lyrics after reading the source material of the anime (_The Misfit of Demon King Academy_). All the characters are strong yet appealing in their own way, so my mind immediately went to lyrics that could draw out those appealing qualities, regardless of who it’s referring to. That’s how I arrived at “strength” as the theme.

But when you think about it, “strength” comes in various forms. There’s strength in battle, but there’s also strength in self-sacrifice for the sake of others, or in staying true to your convictions. They’re all genuinely noble causes, so I wanted the song to express all those ideas.

**— Does it have a particularly impactful line?**

**KT:** There’s this line at the end of the verse, right as the chorus kicks in: “_kimi no tsuyosa wa boku ga shitteiru_” (君の強さは僕が知っている // lit. _I know your strength_). It turns the song on its head. Up until then, the song sounds like a monologue describing one’s emotions, but this line reveals that there’s someone else in the scene.

I want everyone to wonder who “You” and “I” are, and I think that makes the song more relatable the more you listen to it.

**— In the third song** **_Romanron_** **(ロマンロン), I noticed a shift in rhythm after the line “****_mada boku no yume wa himitsu_****” (まだ僕の夢はヒミツ // tl.** **_My dream stays hidden_****). It has lots of those little touches sprinkled all over it. Did you also hum those out as well?** 

https://youtu.be/hOyDpI1XwgM

**KT:**  Yes, all of it. (laughs) I played it in my head, actually, where I imagined how the drum would sound in certain sections. I couldn’t materialize it myself though, so I’d ask Tada-san to bring it to life. 

**— Does that mean you could hear everything play out in your head, including the entire melody?**

**KT:** I pretty much have a vivid idea of the song in my head.

**— I feel like the song was born from a sentiment to affirm the conviction necessary to pursue our dreams even as we mature. So I’d like to ask if there’s a dream you pursue.**  

**KT:** Well, I have a dream that I’m anxiously pursuing, but it is also on its way to coming true. What I’m truly hoping for is for it to keep going.

**— All right. As an artist and a voice actor, what kinds of  ideals or goals do you want to achieve?**

**KT:** I don’t like being too distant from my fans. Not just in a physical sense but emotionally, I want my acting and my songs to have an impact on their lives. It’s that closeness I want to be conscious of.

\[For posterity: This was 2020, and COVID-19 and its subsequent lockdowns happened. Holding concerts became very complicated, making online and reduced/audience-less events the only way to experience them.\]

**— The fourth song,** **_Boku no Miru Sekai, Kimi no Miru Sekai_** **(僕の見る世界、君の見る世界), has quite a spirited mood to it, compared to the rest. Since this was composed with Shigenaga-san, what kind of image were you trying to project?**

https://youtu.be/flso-7QjrH4

**KT:** I wanted a lively rock song that inspires you to go out and run, so I listened to songs that had a similar vibe. Just like with Tada-san, I gave detailed notes of what I wanted. Here, it’s things like how I liked the drums in a certain section, or how I wanted the rhythm to play. 

The process here was different from usual in that the melody was added later in the studio. Normally it starts with the lyrics, followed by the melody, then the chords. But this time around, the chords were incorporated into the lyrics first and then I hummed in the melody.

The chord progression was different from how I usually imagine it so it was worth giving the melody a fresher spin. The song does a good job of capturing the balance between Shigenaga-san’s wonderful skills and my personal flavor.

**_I’m pretty hopeless unless that switch is flipped. (laughs)_**

* * *

**— Your music is a huge departure from the cute persona you project in** **_Nijigasaki High School Idol Club_****. You have a compelling voice that really grips whoever listens to it.**

**KT:** Really? Thank you!

**— Have you always wanted to sing dramatic songs under your name?**  

**KT:** My voice has an intense quality to it, so my singing doesn’t exactly have that light touch. (laughs) So I figure that impactful songs would showcase that best. Once I’m more capable of singing in other styles, I’d love to try and broaden my repertoire.

**— After listening to your songs and hearing you talk about it, I’m of the impression that you’re much more thoughtful, and serious about your work than your age suggests. Oriraji-san even commented during your appearance in his show that you remind him of Kojiruri-san.**

**KT:** It made me happy to hear that.

\[Japanese source: [https://www.nhk.or.jp/radiosp/15h/textlog\_4pm\_kusunoki.html](https://www.nhk.or.jp/radiosp/15h/textlog_4pm_kusunoki.html)**.** For context, they are referring to Kojima Ruriko, a Horipro talent/sportscaster, who made a positive impression on the host for being professional-minded despite having just debuted six months ago.\]

**— Do people often tell you that you’re  mature and you already have yourself figured out?**

**KT:** Hmm… It depends. I feel like I’ve been described as someone who “delivers when it matters.” It’s like someone who’s mature and also goofs off just like anyone their age, but can switch into a mode that gets things done when they need to.

**— Do you think that applies to you?**

**KT:** I’m well aware I’m pretty hopeless unless that switch is flipped. (laughs) I do think I can enter that mode when it’s time to get serious. Because at home, I’m totally like not that. (laughs)

![](/images/9 (1).jpg)

—

**Getting to know more about of Tomoriru! (Lightning round questions)**

**What’s your favorite word?**

**KT:** I’m drawing a blank already! (laughs) Hmm… my favorite motto is “Do well, and it’ll turn out well.”

\[For those curious, the motto is “いいことしてれば、いいことある” which you could simplify as “great in, great out,” “perfection produces perfect,” and many similar sayings.\]

**What’s your favorite book?**

**KT:** _Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close_ (ものすごくうるさくて、ありえないほど近い)

There’s a movie adaptation as well, but I love the original work.

**What’s your favorite season?**

**KT:** Winter. Partially because I don’t really enjoy hot weather, but winter also has all the fun stuff like my birthday, and Christmas, and New Year’s, just to name a few.

Winter’s the best, right? (laughs) I love it’s somewhat subtle aroma in the air.

**If you were an animal, what would you be?**

**KT**: Hmm… a cat. They follow their whims, and they get lost in their own little world once they put their mind to something. Otherwise, they laze around, which sounds just like me.

**What’s a word or phrase you say often?**

**KT:** I tend to say “Um” a lot. (laughs). That and “Like”. I can’t start my sentences without them. (laughs)

\[For those curious, it’s “えー” and “なんか,” which are filler words when used to start a sentence and can be translated into a handful of ways.\] 

**What’s your most appealing aspect?**

KT: If I can refer to my personality, it’s my tenacity.

**What’s something new that you tried during the lockdown period?**

KT: Working out. I did a lot of sit-ups!

**If the world were to end today, what would be your final meal?**

**KT:** That’s a tough one! But it would have to be my mom’s meat and potato stew.
