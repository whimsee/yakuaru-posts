**\-- How was your photoshoot?**  

Eino Airi (EA): It was drizzling, which doesn't happen often, so I got to bring a cute umbrella. I've never been good at taking selfies, especially during high school; my aim was always off, so I don't have a lot of pictures of myself back then. It's still a learning experience but I have to put myself out there as part of my work as a voice actress, which includes taking photoshoots.  

**\-- Did you bring your own outfit?**  

EA: I did. I went out and bought a white casual dress that kind of looks like a sweater-shorts combo. I think it looks good on me.  

**\-- Can you tell me about the movie _Wake Up, Girls! The Shadow of Youth (Seishun no Kage)_** **that** **was just released last week.**  

EA: The TV series ended in a way that we weren't sure if there was going to be a sequel since it was also open-ended. (laughs) So it was fortunate that there was going to be a theatrical continuation. I think the subtitle and the teaser tell enough about the movie but what is unique about Wake Up, Girls! is its emphasis on overcoming adversities. The girls will struggle through hardships but will overcome them once again, finally culminating with them performing the theme song, _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_.

**\-- What about your character, Hayashida Airi?**  

EA: She may be safe from being cut from the group but you’ll see in the movie that she still has a lot to go. (laughs) What I want everyone to notice, though, is the change in herself as she broadens her outlook and realizes the things she should do as she finally comes to grips with herself.  

**\-- How did the recording sessions go?**  

EA: We've all gotten better compared to when we did _Seven Idols (Shichinin no Idol)_. Back then, we were so quiet and tense, but we have better chemistry now, and we've gotten more proficient in front of the mic. We’ve been working hard, encouraging each other along the way, and our acting skills have improved as a result.  

**\-- Who do you get along with the most?**  

EA: Nanamin (Yamashita Nanami) and Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino). Especially Nanamin. We often go on dates where we eat cake, have aromatherapy spa massage sessions, all those fancy stuff. (laughs) We've also stayed over at each others’ apartments several times.  

\[This was a thing around 2014-2015, where everyone was staying over at each others' apartments as the members gradually moved to Tokyo, especially Nanami's since she likes having them over to cook for them.  
  
According to their blog posts and other interviews, the order of members moving out and living in Tokyo is: Mayu -- Nanami -- Airi -- Yoppi -- Miyu/Minami (around the same time). Kaya was already staying in Tokyo with her sister since they were studying/working there.\]  

**\-- How is she on her days off?**  

EA: She exudes so much feminine charm, I could almost fall in love with her. (laughs) Whenever I stay over, she would always cook, prepare the towel when I take a bath, and even make breakfast for both of us in the morning.

**\-- Do you cook?**  

EA: I just moved to Tokyo in February so it hasn't been long since I started living by myself. I can't make fancy dishes yet but I can cook simple stews... that I usually eat for breakfast the following morning.

**\-- That sounds just like Airi-chan's predicament since she also moved to Tokyo. Have you gotten used to it?**  

EA: I think I've mostly gotten used to it, but I still have to get a handle on switching trains since we only have one such station in Sendai. (laughs) Also, being a metropolis, there's way more people in Tokyo compared to Sendai, which reminds me how simple things are in Sendai.  

**\-- I heard you're a big fan of the Rakuten Eagles. I take it you’ve attended their games in person?**  

EA: I have. I love the team and the stadium in Miyagi is just a bike ride away so I often watch their games. Even on rainy days, I just wear my Rakuten cap and go there.

**\-- Apparently, they're not doing well this year.**  

EA: It's really unfortunate... I’m a big fan of Tsuchiya Teppei, but he transferred to the Orix Buffaloes last year. I’m also a fan of Matsumoto Tetsuya from the Yomiuri Giants and Fujita Kazuya and Matsui Hideki from the Rakuten Eagles. All my personal favorites already transferred to other teams... But I guess I should stop here. (laughs) Right now, you can say that I'm a fan of the team as a whole.  

**\-- Speaking of Sendai, how about _Haikyuu!!_?**  

EA: Yeah. If only I were still in Sendai when I got into it... I'm really looking forward to the theatrical release and season 2 in October.  

\[According to her blog, Airi tends to get into anime series late. That was the case with Code Geass where she dropped it early then gave it another go, but also with Haikyuu and Free! where she got into it by the time season 1 was about to finish.\]  

**\-- Have you ever considered getting cast in the series?**  

EA: I think it would feel a little weird to be part of something you love... _Haikyuu_ has an awesome opening that makes me cry whenever I hear it, not to mention the magnificent art and story. Someone like me being part of that almost feels like disgracing it in a way. But given the chance, I'd like to be part of the cheering section or one of Oikawa's groupies. (laughs)

**\-- You sound really passionate about anime.**  

EA: Of course. Right now I'm following _Aoharu x Machinegun_, _School-Live!_, _WORKING!!!,_ and _Durarara!!x2_. Actually, my first job was in a family restaurant because I was influenced by _WORKING!_. Now that I've moved to Tokyo, the atmosphere of Ikebukuro in _Durarara!!_ is really something for me to take in.

**\-- Do you play video games?**  

EA: I play phone games like _Puzzle and Dragons_, but otherwise I just play dating sims. My very first game was _Tokimeki Memorial_ when I was in kindergarten so you could say I grew up with them.  

**\-- Not even** **_Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side_****? I imagine not a lot of girls play games back then.**  

EA: Actually, I think it was pretty normal for girls to play those games until they reach high school. At that point, they'll get into to stuff like _Prince of Tennis_, _Uta no Prince-sama_, and _Starry☆Sky_. Right now I'm playing _Ensemble Stars_, which actually has a dedicated section in Animate, where it has a monitor playing its 10-minute long opening video.  

\[Airi, Miyu, and Minami play visual novels, usually on the Vita. There was a time when all you hear from Miyu and Minami is their love for Little Busters and the copy of the game Miyu owns that they share between each other. Airi voiced a character for a VN that is out on steam ([School of Talent: Suzu-route](https://store.steampowered.com/app/573040/School_of_Talent_SUZUROUTE/)).\]  

\[Regarding female-oriented groups, the members have mentioned in more than a few blog posts that they are fans of King of Prism (Where they had sleepover movie nights and went to multiple theatrical showings), B-Project, and SideM\]  

**\-- Those games are pretty popular nowadays. Finally, can you tell us what kind of voice actress you want to become.**  

EA: I'm always at a loss whenever I get asked that question. My voice sounds wimpy and lacks impact. I'm still learning how to project my voice to become something like _Inu x Boku SS’_s Roromiya Karuta. Just like my anime counterpart, I still have a lot to learn but I hope I get the opportunity to voice a character that many people will love.

**\-- I'm sure your love for anime will shine through your voice work. Do you have any advice to anime fans who want to become voice actors?**  

EA: I was in the same position as most people who love anime but never imagined the possibility of becoming a voice actor. But if there's anything WUG taught me, it's that life can take unexpected twists and turns, so take every opportunity you can get, don't give up, and keep pushing yourself.  

\[Her audition story was pretty lucky. She auditioned almost on a whim because she loves anime and just wanted to at least become an extra in an anime. There's also her love of Sendai and her desire to give back to it in any way after the earthquake. She ended up going all the way, being on the same group with Minami and Mayu, who were candidates for the role of Shimada Mayu, where she was pretty depressed the whole time because she felt everyone else was much better. Director Yamamoto eventually picked her because he wanted someone to connect the setting, Sendai, to the group and its activities.\]
