**Birthday Memories**

* * *

**\-- Since today’s your birthday event, can you recall any memorable birthday anecdotes?**

**Okuno Kaya (OK):** I actually have two in mind… I’m at a total loss which one to choose. 

**\-- Let’s hear about them since it’s your special day, after all.**

**OK:** The first is from my 3rd birthday when my brother made something for me out of origami. I learned of this when I got older and we started rewatching our old home videos. 

It was of me watching my brother folding it, and telling him to hurry up. I was getting excited for it but once the party began and I saw the gifts my parents and my sister were going to give me, I suddenly wasn’t as much anymore; they were fancier gifts so I didn’t want his anymore and I threw it immediately to the ground the moment I received it… that video is still so vivid in my memory. My sister was so upset she told me that if that’s how I’m acting, I won’t be having her gift. My parents said the same and just like that, I didn’t get any.

Watching me do that to my brother actually hurt so much it brought me to tears and I apologized to him.

**\-- Does your family watch home videos together often?**

**OK:** We do. They recorded a lot of them when I was little so we’d occasionally do something like a viewing party to watch them together, which was how that video came about.

**\-- You saw it with your brother?**

**OK:** Yes… It was hard for both of us to watch… Ahh, even thinking about it now makes me feel so guilty…

**\-- What about the other anecdote?**

**OK:** This was from my 17th birthday. I was in high school at the time and that day my dad was out working, my mom couldn’t come because she was working in Tokyo along with my sister, who was in college, and my brother was working part-time.

I remember feeling so lonely being all alone that day. After all, I just turned seventeen, the age when girls are supposed to “bloom”. Welcoming such a special time with a lonesome birthday was just depressing… Then my brother called me. He said he’ll be getting off from work early that evening and asked me what I want to have for dinner. That really lifted my spirits. I told him I want hamburg steak so he told me to get things ready by thawing the ground beef in front of the heater. Then I waited and he made it for me. It tasted bland, however, because somehow the beef didn’t get seasoned at all before getting shaped into patties and cooked. (laughs) He was apologetic.

He also bought me a cake and celebrated for me, though. Our family would normally celebrate birthdays by singing “happy birthday” together and that time he sang for me all by himself while the two chihuahuas that we had at the time also yelped along. It’s a memory I remember very fondly.

**\-- How touching.**

**OK:** I love hamburg steak because it’s my mom’s special dish. I think that was actually the first time we made it ourselves following her recipe.

**\-- Your brother seems to be quite thoughtful of you and the family.**

**OK:** He’s like that. I never talked to him that much during his rebellious phase when he was in 10th grade; I was in 7th grade at the time. But he really softened up after that. I used to be a big fan of professional baseball so every day after school he would buy trading cards for me.

**\-- That’s very kind of him.**

**OK:** I think that’s how we gradually ended up getting to talk to each other.

**Growing throughout her career**

* * *

**\-- It’ll soon be your seventh year since your debut. Looking back at what you’ve done so far, how do you feel about it?**

**OK:** I was able to debut because of a group called _Wake Up, Girls!_ (WUG), so as you’d expect, my career started centering around doing concerts and shows. To be honest, part of me actually wanted to do more voice acting work because while I _was_ doing recordings and other stuff for anime, it’s on top of doing events, which was our main focus.  
  
Now, I’d like to believe it’s what brought me here, that I never really understood how much that time actually helped me.

**\-- What have you learned most, or perhaps changed most for you over the course of your career?** 

**OK:** It’s my mindset. Until then, I pressured myself into being seen as someone young. I debuted at 25, normally considered young, but I was the oldest in the group, where even our 23-year-old member \[Eino Airi\] was treated as a senior. I was very worried I won’t be able to conduct myself as such; I really wanted to be seen as young, as a regular girl at that age, even just a bit.

But as I’ve gotten to see how top veteran actors, whom I look up to, do work for foreign shows and such, I’ve come to appreciate how age can allow you to put out some truly moving and intense voices. Now, I want to get older as soon as possible, maybe become 50 or 60 years old within a year.

\[In WUG, Kaya is the oldest member while also the youngest of her siblings. In contrast, Miyu, the youngest member, is the oldest of her siblings and cousins.\]

**\-- So you’ve gotten interested in acting out roles that require those kinds of voices?**

**OK:** That’s right. Of course, I still want to do anime and stuff related to it, but I’m really into foreign shows and movies. Foreigners just have that mature air in the way they speak, and I don’t think I can pull it off quite yet whenever I voice female foreign characters of the same age. I’d like to achieve that.

**\-- Let’s talk about Stray Sheep Paradise, a 2018 stage play that featured you as the sole protagonist, and had its second run last year. As your first stage play with that role, what about it stuck out to you?**

**OK:** It would have to be being the person that looks after the cast. I never thought I had what it takes to be one, and I’ve never been in that position before. I knew I had to give it my all, but not too much that it would throw off everything else. It’s like things had to be properly balanced out.

**\-- Would being too into it be detrimental?**

**OK:** I wanted the mood to be more relaxed. That’s how I approached Stray Sheep Paradise. I’m not much of a go-getter to begin with, so that carried over and fortunately everyone took to it really well. Of course, we still had to take things seriously but not so much as to create a tense atmosphere.

\[This is referring to her role as 座長 (_zach__ō_) or head of the troupe, who is basically the leader of the cast and whose acting represents them as a whole. They’re basically present all the time and their tasks can extend into more advisory and leadership roles as well.\]

**\-- How did you feel when a second run was announced?**

**OK:** I was surprised. It happened so soon. We just had our first run in the middle of December and then it came pretty much once the new year had started. I was so glad because it probably meant it had resonated with a lot of people.

**\-- Having done other stage shows such as reading dramas, what can you say about the difficulty of performing in them?**

**OK:** In reading dramas, you’re fully aware there’s an audience present that is listening to you while you interact with the cast. So striking a balance is difficult. I’m pretty shy on stage and once the nerves get to me, which happens here more than usual, I’d blurt things out without meaning to. And while I do have a script to follow, I tend to rush through the lines. I feel that it’s something I have to overcome eventually through experience.

**\-- But you’ve had quite a lot of stage experience performing in front of an audience through WUG, so I’m wondering if that experience is different.**

**OK:** It’s completely different. This may be peculiar to idol culture but if you make a mistake while performing, you can just make a face to acknowledge it and people will think it’s cute. But for theater and reading dramas, you have to be flawless. It’s that stark difference that makes it nerve-racking; you can enjoy yourself in a concert but making sure not to mess up a line is always on your mind in a reading drama. You become quite conscious if your emotions are powerful enough to reach the audience right at the very back.

**\-- Through spaces like that, where there’s a captive audience listening intently to every word you say, were you able to convey your emotions to them?**

**OK:** It reached them clearly and I know thanks to everyone who has sent me detailed letters of their impressions.

**Feeling Mentally at Ease Working More Instead of Resting**

* * *

**\-- Having done a variety of roles, what kind of acting are you most conscious of?**

**OK:** Very wacky anime has been a topic a work recently. Every scene is hilarious so you have to make sure to keep your energy up the entire way to be able to stay in character. You have to enjoy it as well so that it carries over well into your performance.

**\-- How do you prepare for those kinds of roles?**

**OK:** I start by looking at the images to get an idea of the mood of the scene. Then I’d repeatedly go over it with the script, thinking of all sorts of ways to make it sound funny, cute, and goofy.

**\-- When does working feel especially fulfilling and enjoyable to you?**

**OK:** I’m happiest when I’m told I’ll be getting new voice work. It gets me curious about what it is, or what kind of show or program it’ll be. If it’s new to me, I’ll do my research and look it up. It gets me so excited.

**\-- Does that mean you get extra excited if it’s for a role you haven’t done before?**  
  
**OK:** Definitely. It tells me I’m capable of doing that now. I really enjoy acting using different voices. I love changing my voice so it’s very exciting to get a job that lets me experiment and discover those variations.

**\-- Are you someone who would rather work every day?**

**OK:** I’m probably more at ease when I have less time to rest. (laughs) I get anxious when I have an entire week to myself. I don’t really have any reason to go out so I just end up staying at home. I’m probably someone who can’t really enjoy having a lot of free time. I feel like I’m wasting it so I’d rather just spend it working. 

**\-- So working makes you feel happy or alive, then?**

**OK:** It truly makes me happy.

**\-- Have you spent a free day traveling by yourself?**

**OK:** Not usually. I’m pretty bad at following written directions. I can’t even look them up myself. (laughs) So I don’t really do it.

**\-- So you spend your days off relaxing at home, watching TV and DVDs and such?**

**OK:** Yes. Though if I stay at home too much, I start feeling like I’m wasting away so I try my best to go out and take walks. (laughs)

**\-- You’ve visited Sanrio Puroland recently, right?**

**OK:** I have. Right as Halloween season started, I felt the urge to visit and went.

**\-- Seeing the pictures you posted online, I could tell with how happy you looked that you really love being there**.

**OK:**  It’s genuinely one of my favorite places.

**\-- I know you’re kind of peculiar in that you’ve mentioned that you want to be married to a wall, and to be reincarnated as a plankton just to get eaten by a whale. Are there any more things about you that other people find odd?**

**OK:** Let me think… Oh, that’s right. I like to touch and scratch people’s fingernails. It’s not something you usually do to other people, though; I can’t just ask a relative stranger if I could touch their fingernails, after all. So I just resist the urge and settle with my own. (laughs)

\[Regarding the wall and whale, she has mentioned them in detail in several places. Basically, she wants to be married to a wall because she loves to talk and they’re reliable, sturdy, and can do nothing but listen, quite literally because they don’t talk back. And she loves whales enough to want to get eaten by them, and whales eat plankton.\]

**\-- Is there something about a person’s fingernails that makes you want to scratch them?**

**OK:** Women have countless ways to fashion their nails nowadays. I compliment my makeup artist’s nails while also touching and scratching them a little. (laughs)

**\-- Does that mean you want to scratch nails you find cute whenever you could?**

**OK:** I try to. I also like nails that look smooth, unpainted, and plain.

**\-- How do people react to it?**

**OK:** They usually laugh and ask what’s wrong. I stop right away but at least I experienced a moment of bliss from it. (laughs)

**Reminiscing The Past**

* * *

**\-- How has the past year been for you?**

**OK:** I was very motivated to open up a new path through my own abilities. It was concerning at first following WUG’s disbandment, but I wanted to take the word “disband” and the negativity surrounding it and turn it around into something positive. I had to force myself to think that way and push forward. I couldn’t really tell if that path was right or not but whatever it may be, I was determined to make it the right one and gave it my best shot starting April that year.

It’s been a great year. Since then, I’ve achieved many of my dreams, which were things that I love and wanted so much to be a part of. And deep down, I realized the possibility of it never happening at all if we hadn’t disbanded, that maybe this was supposed to happen. So while I feel sad about it, getting to make my own progress felt more real.

\[As a timeline note, the seiyuu unit WUG officially ceased activities on March 8, 2019 and is considered disbanded in April, where all its members gradually started opening SNS accounts to promote themselves.\]

**\-- How do you see your fans?**

**OK:** They are my motivation. I look forward to their responses because it always encourages me. My fans, old and new, are all so supportive and deeply appreciate who I am that I’m thankful that whenever I’m happy, they are as well! That’s why I strive to find more opportunities to do good work and announce it to them because I know they’ll be happy to know it.

I may not know what people all over Japan are doing or feeling at any given time, but just knowing that whenever I post an announcement in social media there will be people out there who will think of me and be happy for me is a big motivator.

**Future goals**

* * *

**\-- Since it’s your birthday, I’d like to ask if you have any new goals and pursuits for this year.**

**OK:** I definitely want to focus on doing voice work. I want to do a variety of roles and be in a lot of places. That’s where I want to devote all my efforts.

**\-- Do you have a specific role in mind that you want to perform?**

**OK:** I’d like to voice animals or non-human characters but also adorable child characters since it’s been a long while since I’ve done that. Oh, and I also want to try voicing child characters that have reserved personalities and boy characters as well.

**\-- That’s a lot. How about in your personal life, is there anything you’d like to try?**

**OK:** I’d like to go overseas with friends.

**\-- Is there a particular place you want to visit?**

**OK:** I’m not set on it yet but I want to go to Europe. Though having said that, I want to go somewhere close as well. Asia, maybe. I’ve never done this for my own leisure. Every time I went, it was for work.

**\-- You’ve never been interested in going overseas by yourself, then?**

**OK:** Well, it's just that it might be a bit too much for me to handle… I probably won’t get past the airport here in Japan if I do it alone. (laughs) 

**\-- And that’s why you want to do it with a friend who knows their way around it.**

**OK:** Exactly. I had fun in Singapore and I’d like to go to Korea as well.

**\-- What are your aspirations for this year?**

**OK:** I’d like to fill it with smiles. My goal is to have more things to like. When I really get into something, like an illustrator or an art style I like, I tend to stick with it for a long time, that is until I find out that someone else has discovered it too. I suddenly start feeling that everything I’ve accumulated in regards to it doesn’t feel mine anymore… it’s kind of crazy. Much more that they’re supposed to be out there in the world for everyone to enjoy anyway. (laughs)

**\-- You start losing interest in it once you hear from someone else that they like it too?**

**OK:** It’s like all of a sudden it’s not something that I can privately enjoy anymore. I’d have to find another refuge. So in order to have more of those, I need to look for more things to enjoy… I’m sorry, I know it sounds like utter nonsense. (laughs)

**\-- Do you have any other goals?**

**OK:** I’d love to hold an event in Tohoku. During WUG’s final show in Saitama Super Arena, I read my letter saying that someday I’ll bring everyone to Tohoku, and I’ve yet to accomplish that. I went to Tohoku once last year but not in that capacity, so my dream this year is to hold an event that will do that.

Well, it’s easier said than done since everyone will have travel expenses to consider (but thank you, as always!). But regardless, holding an event is one of my goals.

**\-- Now that you’ve said it here, you have to make it happen.**

**OK:** I know. I’ll do my best!

**\-- Finally, do you have a message to your fans who came to your event today?**

**OK:** This day has always been one of my goals since becoming a voice actress—holding an event with Pochacco, a character I’ve loved since I was a child and have bought numerous notebooks and other goods. Thank you for sharing this dream come true with me, and for celebrating my birthday with Pochacco. I still have lots of dreams that I want to achieve and I sincerely hope we can spend it together. Let’s make 2020 a good one!
