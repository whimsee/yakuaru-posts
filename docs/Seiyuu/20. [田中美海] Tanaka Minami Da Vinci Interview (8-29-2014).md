**\-- Can you give us a brief description of your character, Katayama Minami, from _Wake Up, Girls!_?**  

Tanaka Minami (TM): Minami-chan is a bundle of positive energy and the mood-maker of the group. She comes off as a clumsy airhead but she can be as serious like the rest of them when the situation calls for it.  

**\-- Didn't she also think up her trademark catchphrase "Unmenya~"?**  

TM: She did! That line was actually from our first social game \[_Wake Up, Girls! Stage no Tenshi (ステージの天使)_\]. It went like, "What's this? It's so... Unmenya~" and the staff wanted to keep using it. If I remember correctly, it finally made its anime debut in Episode 3. (laughs)  

**\-- The peculiar way you say it really sells it! Did it originally come out that way?**  

TM: We recorded it a bunch of times. Our sound director advised me to imagine Minami-chan thinking really hard then experiencing a viola moment as she shouts "Unmenya~”. Since it’s her, I wondered if saying it while making the cat pose might work. They loved it and it became the catchphrase that we know and love!  

**\-- Did you encounter any problems during recording?**  

TM: At the beginning, I had trouble understanding instructions from the director and the sound director. My deliveries always came out different from what they envisioned. But the more we did it, the more they corrected me and made suggestions, the better at it I became.

**\-- What's your favorite scene?**  

TM: It's in episode 7 when all the girls finally started working together as a group. That was the first time I cried while watching it because seeing them united, and Minami-chan playing an active role in it, made me realize how great of a character she really is.

**\-- Having worked on _Wake Up, Girls!_ as your voice acting debut, what did you feel when the recording sessions were over?**  

TM: I've always wanted to become a voice actress since I was little, so it never truly sunk in when I finally became one. When I first heard my voice on screen, I was critical of myself more than anything. Recording those episodes felt like a journey of improvement to us, so we treated it seriously.  

\[During her grade school graduation ceremony, she stood in front of everyone, faced them and shouted, “I’m going to become a voice actress!” before accepting her diploma.\]  

**\-- Have you felt any improvement since then?**  

TM: I learned more about myself as a voice actress, and I've become more conscious and open about certain nuances when I watch anime!  

**\-- You must have gone through a lot of training and lessons since passing the audition up until your first recording session.**  

TM: We used to meet in Tokyo every weekend for lessons and we had three training camps last year—Spring break, Golden week, Summer break. You need to be physically fit to perform on stage so every day we would run in the morning before attending singing and dancing lessons. That would be our daily routine during camps and the longest one went on for about 10 days.  

\[Minami and Nanami used to have the least stamina in the group so they ended up becoming training buddies. During camps, they would run together in the morning and encourage each other to do jumping jacks right after. They would do that again at the end of the day, which sometimes worried the hotel manager, who is responsible for making sure all guests are in.  
  
The rest of the girls didn't have any notable stamina problems. Miyu and Kaya used to do track and field. Mayu and Airi used to do sports. They commented that Yoppi, who didn’t do any athletic things in school (mostly choir), surprisingly had no problems with stamina.\]

**\-- Did you also attend acting lessons?**  

TM: We did. I think the point of those lessons was to teach us how to exaggerate our emotions. I couldn't express anger well. They kept telling me I was too gentle, so I practiced by focusing on the emotion itself, instead of the script, until I finally got the hang of it.

**\-- Did you encounter any other issues?**  

TM: I'm not athletic. I couldn't even do sit-ups, so it was tough to do all the muscle training and running exercises. I couldn't keep up with anyone at first! I lacked any sense of rhythm and had no prior dance experience so I couldn't manage to sing while dancing. Couple that with my lack of stamina and I always end up panting. Our songs have intense and complicated choreography and it made me worry. It's piece of cake now, though! I'm sure we can handle both the live tour and Anisama.  

\[Minami was also a bit careless during this period of their showcase events and training camps. She got herself injured by cracking a toe bone and almost didn't make it to the 2nd showcase event.  
  
In terms of injuries and health scares near events (that they wrote about), relatively few aside from that. Mayu got a slight injury during 2nd Tour and Yoppi experienced about 2 separate cases of heat stroke and her voice almost breaking before Festa 2016. They did AnimeJAM on the same day (She sang as part of D-Selections and WUG) and she got too excited that she strained her voice badly before Festa. She panicked but eventually recovered right before show time.\]

**\--What's your favorite WUG song?**  

TM: It would have to be Tachiagare. The intro always gives me goosebumps. It's also the first ever song I memorized and the choreography was tough. Now, it's the one song I know I can be my best at. (laughs)  

\[Around this time, their hard song was 7 Girls War. They would often comment in 2014 how the song always left them exhausted because it was non-stop running and moving while singing.\]  

**\-- What can we expect from _WUG ZOO!_ and Minami-chan?**  

TM: The anime is set in a zoo and Minami-chan's image animal is the tiger that only eats stuff and says "unmenya~"! Being a tiger and all, you'll always see her around meat. (laughs) She looks dangerous but she’s actually cute and friendly.  

**\-- Since you've been cast as Hana N. Fountainstand in _Hanayamata,_ can you tell me something about her?**  

TM: She's a spirited girl from America who loves yosakoi (A style of Japanese dance). She discovered the word because of her love of Japan and while pursuing it, ends up involving many people around her. She's headstrong and someone who tends to act without thinking. It was a fun role because they let me portray her pretty much however I want. She also roleplays often; as an evil person, a ninja, or a shrine maiden, for example. (laughs)

**\-- Isn't playing an energetic character difficult?**

TM: Not at all! It was like turning on a switch inside me and I'm kind of like that normally anyway. (laughs)

**\-- Let's move to topics about you! Rank your top 3 favorite foods.**  

TM: Chocolates, first and foremost! Omelette rice for meals; I love my egg dishes thick and fluffy. And waffles; I always get waffles topped with tons of blueberries and chocolate syrup when I go to a cafe! Actually, my third choice might as well be any kind of sweets since I have a separate stomach for desserts. I can definitely eat a serving of waffles after going through a plate of omelette rice!

**\-- Do you go to all-you-can-eat cake buffets?**  

TM: You don’t even want to know! (laughs) There are so many kinds of cake so I try everything before returning to my favorites. Then I finish up by devouring a serving of chocolate fondue. (laughs)

**\-- How do you spend your days off?**  

TM: I usually hang out with friends. I love karaoke. Sometimes I just do it alone, but it’s always a riot with friends. We also hang out at family restaurants, where we spend hours chatting. (laughs) At home, I usually watch movies and anime on my laptop. Oh yeah, I also spend some of my days off at amusement parks!  

\[Minami likes singing enka songs in karaoke and one of her audition songs was the song she sang at the karaoke portion of Final Live Part 1, _Tsugaru Kaikyō Fuyugeshiki (津軽海峡・冬景色)_ by Ishikawa Sayuri.\]  

**\-- Do you enjoy roller coasters?**  

TM: I love them! The faster the better! (laughs)  

**\-- What’s your favorite theme park?**  

TM: Disneyland, for sure. It’s the place where dreams come true, after all, and you can bring anyone there and enjoy the experience.  

![](/images/tanaka_04.jpg)

**\-- By the way, which ride have you screamed the loudest?**  
  
TM: There’s a trapeze ride called the TEKKOTSU BANCHO at Fuji-Q Highland. You sit on a chair suspended in mid-air then it rises to the top and you get flung out as it spins. It’ll be like you’re flying but also get a clear view of Mt. Fuji. It was so beautiful I couldn’t help but scream me amazement at the top of my lungs. I was so loud that my friends, who aren’t used to me screaming, and a few other kids next to us, freaked out, which made it all the better! (laughs)

**\-- Huh… Wouldn’t that make you a sadist?**  

TM: HA HA HA! I wonder… (laughs) I don’t know why but something about it felt enjoyable. (laughs)  

**\-- Then I'm guessing you’re fine with haunted houses as well.**  

TM: Of course! Actually, we did a shoot for a WUG DVD special at Fuji-Q Highland at a haunted house attraction. Mayushii and Kaya were so against the idea… Actually, I think everyone was except for me and Miyu. I went in first with a flashlight and Miyu came in last with a camera. Everyone was terrified and shrieking at anything that appeared while Miyu and I were just laughing. (laughs) It was so fun.  

**\-- Did you do anything else while you were there?**  

TM: We had a barbecue. It was the first time I prepared meals with everyone. I wanted to make curry with vegetables. Making it isn’t easy, you have to keep an eye on the heat. The sauce ended up being so watery like soup but somehow it was really delicious. It was surreal but I enjoyed it! (laughs).  

\[Contrary to her WUG character, she doesn’t eat a lot and is a picky eater. Only recently did she start liking certain vegetables and expanding her palette.\]  

**\-- Can you tell me a recent story of failure?**  

![](/images/tanaka_05.jpg)

TM:  I was in a hurry to get home and I made the mistake of taking the wrong train. I took the first one I saw without looking where it was heading to and it turned out being an express train going the opposite direction. So it became an unexpected adventure. (laughs) I eventually got home but it’s funny to think that in my haste, I actually became late. (laughs)  
  
Oh, wait. Speaking of dumb mistakes… I went to see Asanuma-san’s (Matsuda Kouhei) stage play and it was so amazing I wrote him an appreciation letter. The next day he approached me and said, “The envelope was empty”. (laughs) Somehow, the letter flew out and he keeps bringing that story up to tease me whenever he gets the chance. (laughs) It’s good that we can laugh about it, though!  
  

**\-- Moving on, what kind of voice actress do you want to become?**  

TM: I want to challenge myself with all sorts of characters! So far, I played many lively roles but someday I hope to voice quiet or cool characters, maybe even young boy roles or mature lady roles. I also love to dance and sing on stage in front of an audience so I hope to do more of them.  

**\-- Finally, a message to our readers!**  

TM: I'm still new to the industry but I’m aiming to reach my goal at full speed so I'm happy to receive your support! Watch out for me!  

**\-- Thank you for coming in for this interview!**
