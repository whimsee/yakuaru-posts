**The emotional event that inspired her pursue voice acting**

**When did you become aware of voice acting as a profession?**

I have an aunt who loves manga so in grade school, I used to read them every time I visit her. Then one day I happened to watch an anime adaptation of one and it fascinated me how, although it looked different, the voices were just how I imagined they would be. That made me conscious in other anime and games that people actually have this neat job of doing voices for them.

**Then, could you tell us what inspired you to pursue voice acting.**

I got deeply into anime and games by the time I finished middle school. Then in my second year of high school, my friend invited me to an event. While it featured voice actors, I wasn’t really into them and only intended to go because I like the anime. They did a reading play, which I listened to just in case there was new dialogue between the characters, and I was moved to tears; they brought my favorite characters to life in front of me. They were so awesome it inspired me to be like them.

That was a significant step for me because I’ve had strong aspirations about my future until then; I’d always thought I’d just go to college and get a job as people usually do. 

**What made you choose to enroll in the Japan Narration Acting Institute?**

I’m the impulsive type where I act the moment the idea strikes me so after that event, I immediately looked for training schools. I found out that _Nichinare_ holds weekly classes, which is conducive for students, so I enrolled once I reached third year.

**Wasn’t it difficult to juggle both academics and voice acting?**

I wanted to focus on voice acting after graduating high school so I told my parents and teachers about it. I was diligent at school so my teachers probably expected that I’d go to college, but my homeroom teacher enthusiastically pushed me to give it a shot now that I thought about it this far. Then in my parent-teacher conference, my parents expressed that they also want to support me because they’ve never seen me so committed about my future until then.

So for that entire year, while everyone was focusing on their entrance exams, I was able to concentrate on voice acting.

**How was your day-to-day life during that time?**

My parents wanted me to work to pay for my expenses at _Nichinare_ so on weekdays, I would finish my activities at my school’s light music club and work part-time. I’ve had that job since first year high school and everyone was supportive about my training. They even let me take weekends off whenever I got busy preparing for presentations.

**Voice actors sing and dance as well?!**

**What can you say about your time in** **_Nichinare_****?**

Being around the lecturers and my classmates, who were pursuing the same dream, you could really feel that everyone was fully committed to it, and I mean that in a good way.

**Do you have any memorable experiences from your basic training courses?**

There’s a rule in my class where you have to raise your hand in order to participate. As someone who used to be terrified of standing out, I remember being so nervous during self-introductions that it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my chest. That said, part of me also wanted to stand out so I made it a point to raise my hand before anyone else.

My voice was trembling at first until I eventually realized that it was pointless to feel embarrassed because we’re all on the same boat so the more I did it, the more I felt proud to show what I can do. The year I spent in that class was me breaking out of my shell and learning how to act to the best of my ability without feeling shy.

**How about the main training course?**

The basic course taught us how to deliver lines, move and express the way we envision it. The main course had us do the same but this time it was to suit a production which really drove home how difficult acting can be. That year-long course taught me that in order to put out a good show for the audience, you can’t just do whatever you want. You also need to consider how it should be presented.

**Since training schools also provide hands-on mic experience, how was it for you?**

It was an experience learning to act while figuring out how to interact with your fellow actors and feeling out your spacing, on top of reading the script and watching the images in front of you. Our class even made a voice drama all by ourselves. I was tasked to do post-editing and I learned a lot of stuff listening to the voices and noting the lines where I could have held back my voice a little more, or where it was hard to make out what someone was saying.

**When did you get into a talent agency?**

I passed the audition that was held after we finished our basic courses. From there, I became part of Arts Vision.

**Can you share anecdotes about your experiences starting out?**

My first job was for a mobile game and my first regular spot was for a radio show but what left quite an impression on me was three years later on my first regular anime role in _Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan_. I was glad being part of the main cast but I was also tense since it also meant I had to do all sorts of voices. (laughs)

My character’s cool and dignified so her voice needed to be strong and stable even when she’s shouting, but I was so nervous at first I was all over the place. It was really difficult because the bulk of my work at the time were games and the director would comment how my acting wasn't suited for anime.

**What’s the biggest difference between recording for games and anime?**

In games, you record alone in the booth. In my case back then, I was a lot of system voices that addressed the player but not much of the sort that involved interaction between characters.

In anime, you’re recording with other people. On my first day recording for _Dragon Pilot: Hisone and Masotan_, everyone was lively and comfortable in their performances while I was just frantically trying to go through line-after-line as if I were performing by myself. 

**How did you overcome it?**

I realized that acting in tandem with someone was something I’ve done numerous times at _Nichinare_. It seemed as if in the process of voicing my first anime as a regular, I forgot everything I learned but I was essentially voicing a character, only this time there were significantly more lines.

After that, as we did more episodes, I started to perform more comfortably. Then as we wrapped up the final episode, it made me really glad to hear from the recording staff that while they were concerned at first, they saw how much I improved. I learned a lot through that experience, and it was also the work where I was able to fully utilize my experiences from _Nichinare_.

**How about for** **_Zombie Land Saga_****, where you exhibited your singing and dancing ability?** 

I owe it completely to the song and dance lessons I took at _Nichinare_ three times a week. (laughs) I couldn’t even do simple steps at first and the other members had experience doing these things so it was rough catching up to them. I even practiced a lot at home.

**You weren’t looking to sing and dance as a voice actress?**

Actually, I had no idea voice actors do that as their respective characters. When I did learn about it, I never thought I’d ever do it. But that changed once I got on stage. Seeing the audience right in front of me react to my portrayal of my character and be moved by it, even to tears, made all that effort and practice worth it. In the future I want to work harder to perform not as myself but instead an embodiment of that character who can entertain the audience.

**Acting is built up through life experience**

**What other areas has** **_Nichinare_** **helped you since you started working?**

There’s a lot but I’ll start with how voice is perceived in terms of age. I tend to sound older than the characters I portray and I’ve even been asked during auditions to make my voice sound younger. It was helpful learning with classmates of different ages since it allowed me to quickly change my voice to sound, say, five years younger.

Laughing as well! Imagine when the boy sitting in front of you has a grain of rice on his face, or when a stranger trips in front of you… I learned laughing intensively in _Nichinare_ so if I have to laugh more merrily or more subdued, I have lots of scenarios to draw from.

**What is the appeal of voice acting for you?**

![](/images/img06.jpg)

It’s fun and fulfilling that I can be anyone from a young kid to a high school student, a _gyaru_, _yanki_, a sexy lady, or a mature figure. I can’t say there’s a particular trope that fits me completely yet so I’ll have to discover that in the future.

**What kind of voice actor do you want to become?**

It’s important for me as an actress to portray all sorts of characters but I also like to just talk and goof around so I’m having a lot of fun as a radio personality and I hope everyone likes this other side that I show in them. And as someone who was inspired by voice actors, I also want to become someone who can do the same to others.

**Finally, kindly share a message to aspiring voice actors.**

The secret to acting is to meet different people and to try all sorts of experiences! You can’t win the lottery if you don’t buy a ticket, you can’t enjoy the view from the top of the mountain if you don’t climb it. You don’t miss out in trying so don’t be afraid to give things a shot!
