This dual interview focuses on her interest in music, and goes deep into the songs of her debut single and her writing philosophy. There’s some overlap between both interviews but they’re worth translating as they cover the songs a bit differently.

It complements a previous interview, which covers a wider range of topics about her, so give that a read (link below) if you’re interested.

**Lisani Interview (8-12-2020)**

**Singing and Voice Acting — Making Strides in Both Passions.**

* * *

**— I’ve been listening to your radio show** **_Kusunoki Tomori The Music Reverie_****, and I’m surprised that you have a wide range of musical interests for your age. You’re not just into pop and rock, but also western classics such as those from Daryl Hall and John Oates.**

**Kusunoki Tomori (KT):** I’m glad you noticed! My dad and my sister enjoy those classics quite a bit so I grew up listening to them at home and on car trips. We really only listen to the popular ones but it did pique my interest in songs from different generations.  

**— And also I heard, to my absolute surprise, you singing _Hakkoutai_ (発光体) by Yura Yura Teikoku in your karaoke segment. (laughs)**

**KT:** That was a song request. We received a lot of anisong and J-POP requests for the segment and that one stood out right away. (laughs) The only thing I knew of the band was the name, but their music was very funky and out-there, so I figured how neat it would be to sing it for my listeners who were just chilling and waiting for the show to start.

**— I could tell from your show how genuine you are in your love of music. Didn’t you mention in a previous interview that you originally auditioned to become a singer?**

**KT:** It’s a long story. I initially wanted to be a voice actress. But then I entered a competition where you read lines in front of professional voice actors. I failed to make an impression and fell in the qualifiers, and it left me completely heartbroken.

And yet, I really wanted to work in the anime industry, whatever form it may take, so figured I should approach it as a singer instead. I always loved music and I was the vocalist of our high school’s light music club. From there I found _Anistoteles_, which was organized by the agency I’m currently part of. It was open for everyone as long as they’re passionate about anime, so I entered with the intention of becoming a singer while also mentioning in my interview that I wanted to do voice acting as well if possible. There was never really a preference between singing or voice acting; I pursued both of them wholeheartedly.

**— That’s where you won the special award, which led to your voice actress debut in 2017. Since then, have you always wanted to start a singing career?**

**KT:** Yes. My management offered me the opportunity to debut as a voice actress so while I was happy for that dream to be fulfilled, I gave singing an honest shot and I couldn’t let it go. Incidentally, Tada Mitsuhiro, who I’d just begun taking voice lessons from at the time, was holding his acoustic shows. Getting to perform there allowed me to sing in front of an audience on a regular basis, which kept the dream alive and my desire to pursue it. 

**— And with Tada-san’s help, you started out in the indie scene and released 2 CDs under your name. Since you mainly produced and composed the songs, did you have any prior experience in song making until then?**

**KT**: I barely had any. I never studied song making but I did it once during my time in the light music club, and it went nowhere. But I’d been singing covers in Tada-san’s acoustic shows so I approached him about making one and he encouraged me to give it a go. What came out of it is the first ever song I’ve written and composed, and it’s a coupling track for this release, _Nagame_ _no Sora_ (眺めの空).

**— It’s also in** **_Acoustic CD \[bottled-up\]_****, released in 2018. I’m curious, what instrument do you use to make music?**

**KT**: I learned a bit of piano when I was little. I played the trumpet during grade school and middle school. And I started playing the guitar after entering this industry. I don’t use any of that in creating the melody, though. I hum.

**— Since you were pursuing a musical career as an independent artist, I imagine you were overjoyed when your major debut was announced during your birthday concert.**

**KT:** I was utterly bewildered. My manager told me about that, singing the tieup song for _The Misfit of Demon King Academy_, and voicing Misha (Necron) all at once. (laughs) It was a goal of mine to write and compose songs for a tieup, so I was a bit concerned when the chance of doing it actually came. (laughs) I was ecstatic for another dream to be realized that I could hardly believe it was happening.

**— What do you think about** **_The Misfit of Demon King Academy_****?**

**KT:** I read the source material and I’m amazed that something like this exists. (laughs) The protagonist, Anos (Voldigoad), is a reincarnated demon king from 2000 years ago, and he is depicted as a noble character who possesses a strength that’s impossible to comprehend.

**— It must have been fun to read about someone that absurdly strong.**

**KT:** I breezed through the volumes because you don’t usually get a protagonist who can just power through the sorts of ridiculous situations he finds himself in with no finesse whatsoever. (laughs) I was totally engaged and I didn't know where to stop.

It was an immensely enjoyable read. But that got me concerned about the song’s theme because it’s a work that has a lot going on in it, including a cast of characters who are all likeable in their own way.

**— As the voice of the heroine, Misha, how did you approach her portrayal?**

**KT:** It was a fresh challenge given that I’ve voiced many anime characters that let me jump freely between all manner of emotions. Misha starts out as an adorable girl who doesn’t impose on Anos, so I portrayed her as a comforting and lovable presence. But while the rest of the characters are hot-blooded and easy to read, Misha’s has a straightforward yet steady personality, making it hard to tell what she’s really thinking. When she does speak her mind, it’s only through short utterances or vague responses. And with the limited range of outward emotions she has compared to others, overplaying my performance would overstate her feelings so striking that balance became a difficult task.

* * *

**_Hamidashimono,_ Giving a Nod to The Anime and The “Strength” Born From Experience.**

* * *

**— Since you wrote the lyrics for _Hamidashimono_ (ハミダシモノ), the ending song for the anime, what aspect of it were you particular of in writing the lyrics?**

**KT:** Right away, I wanted to avoid writing a song about a specific character, so I started by figuring out what’s in common between all the characters introduced so far, and I found that they all possess their own kind of “strength.”

Strength comes in many forms: There’s not just strength in battle, but also strength to be resolute, strength to be self-sacrificing for the sake of others, strength to pursue one’s goal, strength to be open about one’s weaknesses, and so on. With that as the theme, I wrote the lyrics in a way that gets interpreted differently depending on which character it's applied to.

**— Among those forms of strength, which one do you relate to?**

**KT:** It’s hard to just categorize it based on the characters we’ve seen so far. I believe that this “strength” is made up of various aspects and I didn’t write the lyrics simply with the anime and its characters in mind. I wanted it to be relatable to people like you and me.

So I ruminated over what one’s strength is all about, and arrived at the conclusion that my strength is that I'm uncompromising once I’ve decided on something, whatever hardships may come. I always held that sentiment on the back of my mind when writing the lyrics.

**— That goes back to what you previously mentioned regarding your audition. As a song based on that “strength," _Hamidashimono_ as a title makes it a powerful draw in my opinion.**

**KT:** _Hamidashimono_ is someone who is out of step with the world; that undoubtedly makes them the minority. It’s as though it contradicts the positive connotation of the word “strength,” which is a notion that I don’t agree with at all.

I feel that it’s very difficult to be your own person nowadays. It’s really hard to find acceptance in a society that doesn’t consider standing out as a particularly good thing. That’s not how I want to see things and I’m adamant in acknowledging that what makes us strong are the things that set us apart from others. That’s exactly why I gave it that title.

**— The word itself is also a reference to the anime’s theme of someone who doesn’t play by the rules, so it lines up with the sentiment that you want to communicate.**

**KT:** It’s a perfect match. Actually, it took a long time before I arrived at that title. The composition was already done, and as we added the lyrics to the demo track, I found that the chorus started out with a “ha” sound and singing it was impactful and easy to impart nuance into, so I decided to have that sound lead the chorus. Then I looked for marketable words that begin with “ha,” leading to _hamidashimono,_ and I got all excited as the pieces fell into place. (laughs)

**— As the title suggests, have you ever experienced feeling like a minority?**

**KT:** I felt like one when I was a student. In middle school, for example, I was student council president but I had a hard time making friends. I was a go-getter since grade school, and I was very willing to take on roles that put me in front of people on behalf of others. Apparently, that wasn’t normal, so I stopped doing that in high school and just did whatever I pleased. (laughs) But I was going to a college prep school so it was expected of us to take entrance exams, and I was the only one who didn’t. I chose to pursue a career in the performing arts instead, and the shock from everyone around me kind of dampened my resolve.

**— I see. It’s true that there’s a compulsion to follow what everyone else is doing in a school community. I know it all too well. It was hard to do much if anything when I was in school.**

**KT:** Yeah. That part of my life probably affected me deeply. That’s why I’m hoping I could tell those who feel that way that it’s all right. 

**— This reminds of how the second verse is very down-to-earth, with lines such as** **_saiteita uwasabanashi no kaori wa nouhou de atoajiwarui kajitsu no youdatta no (_****咲いていた噂話の香りは 濃厚で後味悪い果実のようだったの) and** **_makkura de mienai hiyari to fureru kou’i_** **(真っ暗で見えない ヒヤリと触れる好意).**

https://youtu.be/F0A86w3mdRY

**KT:** The lyrics of the first verse are closer in concept to the anime since it gets heard in the show. But for the second verse, with input from staff, I focused on more personal themes. So while it still applied to the anime, it spoke more from my personal sentiments.

\[For context, rough translations for the equivalent lines referenced:  
(1st verse — anime)  
際限ない争いの行く先は  
本当の僕らの命の価値を見出せるかい?  
_Do we uncover the true worth of our lives at the end of an endless battle?_  
  
真っ白で名も無いラベルを貼られていた  
_The stark white, nondescript label was spread over… (cont.)_  
  
(2nd verse — personal)  
咲いていた噂話の香りは  
濃厚で後味悪い果実のようだったの   
_The smell of flowering gossip akin to a fruit with a nasty aftertaste._  
  
真っ暗で見えないヒヤリと触れる好意   
_Dread and the touch of kindness, invisible in the dark… (cont.)_\]

**— What part in particular speaks out the most?**

**KT:** It’s exactly the one you brought up. I thought you noticed it. (laughs) All my songs so far are like this, where the second verse conveys what I really want to say. I wanted a catchy chorus so that part has lots of abstract imagery, and I made the first verse consistent with the anime. That allowed me to be more genuine in writing the second verse. Actually, that’s usually where the essence of the song is located. 

\[It’s common for tieup songs to be more personal and/or experimental starting from the second verse. Since these songs are meant to complement the anime in a marketable way, there’s a lot of executive control in the first 90 seconds of the song. This ends up being the “TV cut” or “TV size,” though the cut isn’t always from intro to first chorus. Everything else is practically free rein, with some extended cuts found in album releases.\]

**— Another way of interpreting the chorus is that it carries a certain strength that empowers someone when they’re about to falter. I think that lines up well with Anos’ character.**

**KT:** I’m glad to hear that. The chorus is a pure burst of power, so I wanted to include a feeling of strength similar to Anos' that’s guiding and protective.

**— That makes me wonder if that’s the “strength” you wanted to impart. Was there anything in particular you were mindful of when you introduced the lyrics to the song?** 

**KT:** Since I wrote the lyrics, I took it upon myself to clearly express the nuance in each part of the song. We recorded the vocals in multiple takes and instead of just picking which sounded best, I tried out different approaches and chose the one that suited the subtleties of the song. And Shigenaga (Ryōsuke)-san helped in deciding the instrumentals that ultimately complemented the mood and cadence of the lyrics.

In particular, the first half of the verses, and the chorus are unique: Each verse starts out slow and gradually builds up to a crescendo, while the chorus is powerful and explosive.

**— Your voice** **_does_** **lend itself to being dramatic.**

**KT:** The song has a lot of variety and I feel like I won’t do it justice if my vocal expression doesn’t match up to it. Like with the “ha” sound I mentioned before; I actually gave it a raspy delivery to give the chorus a strong impact, which I hope people pick up on.

**— Since** **_Hamidashimono_****’s composition and arrangement was done with Shigenaga-san, how’s your experience working with him?** 

**KT:** I’ve worked with Shigenaga-san a couple of times because he did the entire arrangement for the coupling tracks. He really got what I wanted to do for _Hamidashimono_. This was my first time incorporating lyrics to a song that had already been composed, and I could tell that he matched it perfectly with my voice and singing style.

* * *

**Songs That Resonate—Kusunoki **Tomori**’s Soul as An Artist**.

* * *

**— Now, let’s talk about the coupling tracks. _Nagame no Sora_ and _Romanron_ (ロマンロン) are from your days as an indie artist and they’re rearranged by Shigenaga-san for this release.**

**KT:** Tada-dan did the arrangement for the original, so I’m very glad that two versions of the song exist now. Personally, I don’t see them as one replacing the other, rather the arrangements are completely different approaches to the song so I encourage everyone to spot the differences between them.

**— For** **_Nagame no Sora_****, what inspiration did you draw from?**

**KT:** Well… I was at home eating ice cream at the time. (laughs) That’s my first time writing and composing a song, so I was hesitant to make a song that reflects my personal beliefs. Instead, I decided to go with a fantasy scenario that revolved around ice cream. That said, it had to be relatable and it would defeat the purpose if it strayed too far from reality. That’s why the lyrics are meant evoke the five senses like sight and taste, and you slowly lose them as the song progresses so listeners can draw parallels with their personal experiences.

**— I agree that the lyrics depict quite a vivid image. As lazy summer days are concerned, nothing could be better than ice cream as a concept.**  

**KT:** And I’m sure it’s hilarious that this was being written as one was being devoured. (laughs) That said, I also wanted to associate the sweltering heat with the angst and hardships that we face in our teens and I think I did a good job bringing those themes together.

**— The new arrangement gives off a completely different vibe. The previous version sounds folksy with the acoustic arrangement, but this one is done with a full band ramping up that burning impression.**

**KT:** Exactly! The acoustic version feels like a more somber soliloquy, but the band version projects a more vivid image, imparting a heavier impact to its message.

https://youtu.be/Hjnx2\_ejF5Y

**— How about your ideas behind** **_Romanron_****? It has quite a complex and frantic arrangement as a guitar rock song.**

**KT:** It started out with an idea about making a song with an irregular rhythm. Then as I contemplated on the kind of lyrics it would have, my mind went to a conversation I had with a friend about pursuing your dreams. Having experienced how hard that is, I wondered if I could render it in lyrical form.

There’s a time in our lives when we can freely pursue our dreams with no care in the world, and I believe that’s during our six years in grade school. Once middle school comes around, we start becoming more conscious of the world around us, and in high school we’re often advised to be realistic in how we plan our future.

I think it’s awesome for someone to continue chasing their passions relentlessly in the midst of all that pressure, and _Romanron_ was meant to be the kind of song that acknowledges that.

**— And if we bring that back around to what you’ve said throughout this interview, I guess standing up for yourself and what you believe in is the core idea that you want to convey.**

**KT:** That’s essentially what it is. I didn’t just blindly pursue my dreams so I know that there are countless young people out there who have already given up on theirs. But rather than just telling them to give it their best shot, I was adamant in writing a song that reaches out to them and empathizes with that sentiment. 

**— So that irregular rhythm is your way of expressing it, then?**

**KT:** Well, anxiety is a constant companion in that pursuit, right? Sometimes you feel validated, other times you’re just done with the world. It’s a difficult time where your emotions just go up, down and around, and the rhythm is meant to reflect that instability. I think it all came together well.

https://youtu.be/hOyDpI1XwgM

**— Well said. We have another song that you wrote and composed, and then arranged together with Shigenaga-san,** **_Boku no Miru Sekai, Kimi no Miru Sekai_** **(僕の見る世界、君の見る世界). What’s the production process for this?**

**KT:** It started with the lyrics, which I showed to Shigenaga-san with an idea of how I wanted the song to go. Then he created a demo with full instrumentals, and then in the studio, I hummed out the melody that goes with the chords. Once we’re happy with the melody, we record the vocals for that section. Then we do that all over again until it’s done. (laughs) We were in constant communication throughout the process.

**— That almost sounds like a jam session. The melody has a lively pop music feel to it and the lyrics convey the same themes that you spoke of earlier.**

**KT:** There’s indeed a connection. Often when we admire an actress or a voice actor, we emulate them to the extent that, before we know it, we’ve already discarded who we are. We end up failing to see the good in ourselves and become unable to surpass them. I’m guilty of this too and this song is me saying that we should stop doing that. That while it’s all right to follow in our idol’s footsteps, we all have our own paths to take and it’s important to appreciate yourself as well. That’s the metaphor baked into the song’s narrative.

**— So it’s being upfront in stating how valuable it is to be yourself. In that sense, I have to say that the “tu tu tuu ru ♪” in the chorus is pretty cute.**

**KT:** Thank you! The lyrics play an important part, of course, but I also just wanted to make be a fun rock song. So as long as people enjoy it, I’m happy.

https://youtu.be/flso-7QjrH4

**— Actually, I noticed that you use “boku” as the first-person pronoun in your lyrics. Why is that?**

**KT:** I normally refer to myself with “watashi,” so it would feel like I’m talking too much about myself if I use it. I want my songs to resonate and relate with its listeners and placing myself front and center just doesn’t feel right. So I make it a point to distance myself with “boku.” 

**— Fascinating. So you try to separate yourself a little from the song as you make it.**

**KT:** Exactly. I’m speaking hypothetically here, but if worse comes to worst, I want my songs to live on. I don’t see them as “done” once they’re finished and released. I believe that songs are colored by how we interpret it when we hear it for the first time. Putting myself in that would just get in the way of the process. And besides, I’m more interested in what people feel about the lyrics. That’s why I take “myself” out of the equation.

\[Normally, _boku_ is described by its gender connotation (used by both sexes, gender slightly leaning toward masculine). Here, it has more to do with emotional distance since it’s a safe, flexible, and somewhat casual alternative to _watashi_ in most cases.\]

**— Your debut release is a superb production. All the songs carry a consistent message, and there’s a distinct variation between their respective melodies and arrangements. I’m curious as to your thoughts about your future as an artist.**

**KT:** Whatever happens, I intend to continue making music. I want my songs to clearly convey the things I wish to impart yet presented in a way that is relatable. For that, having debuted at my age, I want to write lyrics that I could only write during this precious stage of my life—words that are true-to-life, nothing more, nothing less.

As for music in general, I still have a lot of growing ahead of me as I continue to discover my strengths. I hope that I stay true to my principles and make music that speaks to the hearts of everyone.

**Musicvoice interview (9-4-2020)** 

![](/images/3 (1).jpg)

**Acknowledging That Everyone is Different and Unique.**

* * *

**— How did you feel about debuting as a solo artist?**

**KT:** I was aiming for a music career before I became a voice actress, so I’m overjoyed that it came to fruition. That said, I also felt some pressure because I’ll be debuting with an anime tieup song.

**— How so?**

**KT:**  When I was an independent artist, I could freely and openly write songs about anything that crossed my mind. But for a tieup song, I have to step it up. It’s a different and unfamiliar compulsion where the song is part of a greater whole and I want it to meet the fans’ expectations. 

**— You mentioned that you were aiming for a music career. When did you start taking an interest in it?**

**KT:** It started in high school. I originally wanted to become a voice actress, but then I entered a competition that my mom recommended to me where the winner gets to voice a TV commercial. I couldn't make it past the qualifiers. That got me to reconsider because the industry seemed impossible to get into without some form of education.

But I really wanted to be involved in anime in some way, so I thought of other ways of getting my foot in the door. I loved singing, having grown up with my family singing karaoke on a regular basis, so I wondered if I could be an anisong singer instead and entered the audition of the agency I eventually signed with.

**— Who are your artistic influences?**

**KT:** _Haruka to Miyuki_ is a huge influence. Because of my family, I never had any specific genre preferences growing up. But if I had to choose, I particularly respect and appreciate artists who have a powerful message in their lyrics and can evoke darker emotions in their wordplay.

While _Haruka to Miyuki_ uses more implicit expressions, their lyrics project vivid and captivating imagery thanks to their powerful wordplay. And Haruka, the vocalist, is amazing in bringing those emotions to life despite her tender voice. I enjoy how expressive it is, so much that I’ve been to their live shows.

**— Since you’ve been making music, I’d like to ask what got you into it.**

**KT:** After being signed with my agency, I started taking voice lessons from Tada Mitsuhiro, who is also the bandleader in my concerts. He used to hold regular acoustic shows, and I got to be a part of those. I started out singing covers but at some point I approached him about making a song. He encouraged me to give it a shot and that attempt became one of the coupling tracks for this release, _Nagame no Sora_. 

**— It’s an achievement to finish a song in your first attempt.**

**KT:** It was challenging, but it didn’t take a lot of time to make. I remember finishing it on the same day I consulted him about it and I even got him to listen to it. It was a smooth and fun experience because I was really itching to make a song that time.

**— What’s your process?**

**KT:** I basically do it all on my phone. The lyrics are written down as memos. I can play a few instruments but I just record voice memos of myself humming out melodies. Then I make something out of those fragments. That’s why I can relax by just lounging about on my bed, phone in hand, as I piece them all together. (laughs)

**— What did you think of your debut song** **_Hamidashimno_** **when you first heard it?**

**KT:** It’s powerful and energetic, a perfect fit for the anime _The Misfit of Demon King Academy_. The impressive use of the piano and other instrumentals really brought out the subtleties in the song’s expression.

**— I love how it’s titled** **_Hamidashimono_****. At first glance, it sounds negative but another way of looking at it is being nonconforming. Was that how you originally envisioned it to be?** 

**KT:** Any given work consists of various aspects so I thought long and hard about lyrics that could evoke an image that keeps viewers coming back week after week. I eventually arrived at the characters; while they are immensely strong, they have their own differences, insecurities, and circumstances, which means the strength they possess is made up of those positives and negatives.

So without downplaying their idiosyncrasies, I considered how the lyrics could apply to any of them depending on how you interpret it. Because while standing out and being different makes one a minority, I wanted to celebrate that uniqueness.

**— When did you decide on the title?**

**KT:** The title’s always the last thing I think of but I had a hard time deciding for this. When I sang the demo, which had different lyrics at first, the chorus started with a “ha” word. It was convenient to impart nuance into that sound, so I decided that the title had to start with that too. Finding words that begin with “ha” that also fit with the anime’s theme lead me to _Hamidashimono_. It had a nice ring to it so it became the title. 

**— So it revolved around that “ha” sound.**

**KT:** I searched long and hard on the internet and I couldn’t find the perfect word. Then as I began considering just scrapping the idea and moving on to another part of the lyrics, it just kind of showed itself. Writing it in hiragana would be too on-the-nose so I decided to write it in katakana instead to make it more compelling and cryptic when you see it.

* * *

**Adolescent Emotions Put Into Words**.

* * *

**— Since we’re talking about the title, have you experienced feeling as though you’re different from the norm?**

**KT:** I’m unconventional in a lot of ways, so much that even I often wonder if I’m weird. (laughs) I used to feel embarrassed about it that I tried my best to hide it. But now that I’m in a line of work where acting and singing is a form of expression, I’ve come to realize that as my strong point. So I feel glad instead whenever I discover those differences.

**— What do you mean by unconventional?**

**KT:** Like the fact that I’m completely okay with complete silence. I’m not bothered at all when I'm in a room with several people and there’s no noise or chatter. Normally, people get restless and strike up random conversations but it doesn’t bug me, which I’ve just realized is a pretty odd thing. I rather enjoy it. (laughs)

**— And that makes you a misfit, as the title of the song suggests.** 

**KT:** You could say that. (laughs) So I’d like everyone to listen to the song and see how it applies to their personal experiences.

**— You brought it up a while ago but the first song you wrote and composed is a coupling track for this release,** **_Nagame no Sora_****. A summer love song. What were your ideas behind it?**

**KT:** _Nagame no Sora_ is my first song, so I felt hesitant drawing from my own ideas and experiences. So I decided to write it like a fantasy novel where you have to listen through the entire song for everything to come together. And while it is fantastical in nature, I didn’t want it to stray too far from reality, so I evoked the five senses as a way to ground it to our own shared experiences.

**— Speaking of summer love songs, there’s an expression that usually goes like “You made my summer.” Here it feels like it’s the opposite, like it’s saying “You spoiled my summer.”** 

**KT:** Indeed. I was still in high school when I wrote this, so instead of awkwardly writing encouraging lyrics, it was better to base it on things that could only be expressed during our teenage years, which would be fascinating to come back to later in life. That’s why the wordplay is a bit twisted as it reflects the experience of adolescence.

**— Now I’m curious if you can share any memorable summer experiences.**

**KT:** Our family has an annual tradition where we get together in summer to watch fireworks over barbecue. And I always look forward to our family reunion during Obon season when I get to hang out with my cousins who I haven’t seen in a while. That’s why summer for me is being excited about Obon and barbecue.

**— During your birthday concert, it must have been a blast to perform** **_Romanron_** **in front of an audience that was spinning towels over their heads.**

**KT:** It’s an energetic song with a catchy chorus, so when in writing the lyrics, I figured it should complement the rhythm while emphasizing its anxious vibe. At the time, I had a friend who was trying her best to pursue her dream. It was really cool and it inspired me to express that in the lyrics.

**— Isn’t** **_Romanron_** **a wordplay on Romanticism?**

**KT:** Following your dream is a romantic pursuit. I think dreams are an especially delicate topic to bring up because we all view our dreams differently. And no matter where you are in the world, we’re often told how difficult it is to pursue it and with so many roadblocks at every turn, a lot of people give up. That’s why the title is _Romanron_—it’s a way of asking everyone to respect how each of us values our dreams. 

**— It’s like saying we all have our own ideas of what that romantic pursuit is. Speaking of dreams, now that you’ve achieved your dream of becoming a voice actress and a singer, do you have anything else that you want to realize?**

**KT:** I know it’s a difficult time but I’ve always wanted to hold a concert and eventually a tour across Japan. While I’ve done concerts as an indie artist, I want people to come and see me now as a major artist so I get to share a fun time with them.

And since Shigenaga Ryōsuke composed _Hamidashimono_, someday I’d love to create an anime tieup song entirely by myself while also voicing its main character.

**— How about if they let you do the ending song or a character song?**

**KT:** That would be something as well. (laughs) A girl can dream.

**— I like how cute and lively** **_Boku no Miru Sekai, Kimi no Miru Sekai_** **is compared to your other songs.**

**KT:** It’s been a few years since it was made so I worked with Shigenaga-san in giving it a fresh take, though it’s a bit unique in that respect. I showed my lyrics to him and, using the original song as a reference, we deliberated and finally arrived at a version that works for the both of us. Whenever we came across an unfinished section, he would quickly whip up a full instrumental demo, and I would finish it in the studio by humming out the melody. And once it’s consolidated, we recorded the final master until it all came together.

**— So both of you built it up section by section in the studio.**

**KT:** The chords were already set, but thanks to Shigenaga-san we were able to create melodies that I wouldn’t have thought of on my own and the song ended up with a unique tone while retaining my personal flair. 

**— I’m curious about the line** **_boku no miru sekai wa nobikitteiru_** **(僕の見る世界は伸びきっている || TL:** **_I see my world stretching out_****). It’s an interesting turn on the phrase “stretching out.”**

**KT:** You can think of it like a passing train. You know how, from the inside looking out, the scenery in front of you appears to stretch out horizontally as it speeds along? You see the same thing but with the train instead when it passes right in front of you. That’s where I got the idea.

It’s a metaphor of how we spread ourselves because we’re unable to hold onto each and every part of us at every moment of our lives. That as the world continues to turn, we leave pieces of ourselves behind.

**— I see. That’s quite profound. Since the lyrics speak of the difference between ideals and reality, I’d like to know if you look up to anyone.**

**KT:** I look up to a lot of people and that number is steadily growing. Just by voice actors alone, there’s a lot I respect for their technique and experience. And let's not get into the number of artists I admire. It’s difficult to deal with because you end up becoming fixated.

Once you admire someone, you want to be like them and it enables you to see how you could improve. But the downside is getting too caught up with imitating them that you begin to lose those chances to reinvent yourself and you become unable to see the good in you as a result. It’s the kind of song I’d strongly urge myself to listen when I feel stuck.

**— What does admiration mean to you?**

**KT:** I wrote about it in the liner notes: “Admiration can be a curse.” It’s good to have one as a short-term goal but with my personality, it compels me to emulate everything about the person and I wind up losing sight of myself. And before I realize it, it influences everything I do.

**— I’m getting the impression that you have a knack of seeing things from a unique perspective. So in that sense, have you ever felt uneasy or discontented with society in general?**

**KT:** I think I’ve had this mindset for a long time now. I’d ponder and question my place in the world, if things are truly what they seem, or that the world we see might be too good to be true. This probably stemmed from my school years, during the time when I didn’t have a lot of friends and I often wondered what the person in front of me was thinking. I’d be at odds with myself about what is right or wrong because in order to understand someone, you have to be more lenient with your values and recognize what is “normal” for them.

**— That must be a bit troublesome to deal with in everyday interactions.**

**KT:** If only you knew. (laughs) Whenever someone messes up or when people get into arguments, it gets me wondering almost automatically what they were thinking at the time or if they really mean the things they said.

But it is useful for acting. It allows me to understand my character better as I unravel why they would respond or act a certain way to another character when they are spoken to.

**— Now, let’s wrap up this interview with my final question. What kind of music can we expect from you in the future?**

**KT:** I’d love to push my boundaries, all while staying true to my core values. I want to make songs that bring the best out of the instruments that play it. And since my lyrics talk about things important to me, I hope it gives a sense of validation to people who relate with it.
