_Onsen Musume_ is a project to promote regions all across Japan that feature hot spring resorts (onsen) using voice actresses who portray characters modeled after their respective hot spring resorts. Through idol activities and events, the project aims to give smiles and joy to everyone, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima.

It has been two years since the project was launched and as a show of gratitude to everyone who has supported it since then, a song had been made. The title is _Tsuishin, arigatou_ (追伸、ありがとう) \[literally, "P.S. Thank you"\] and it is themed as a "letter" in the form of a song addressed to all the poka-danna and poka-okami (_Onsen Musume_ term to refer its supporters) for their involvement in the project.

_Tsuishin, arigatou_ releases on April 26, 2019. It is performed by onsen musume from regions that had been previously hit by earthquake disasters—[Iizaka Mahiro](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/iizaka_mahiro) from Fukushima Prefecture by Yoshioka Mayu,  [Aso Homura](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/aso_homura) by Takahashi Mari and [Hitoyoshi Aoi](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/hitoyoshi_aoi) by Aoyama Yoshino, both from Kumamoto Prefecture who had suffered two separate earthquake disasters. With their voices, they give their support to every region.

Cho! Animedia presents this interview with Yoshioka Mayu to commemorate its release. We ask her thoughts about her onsen musume, idols, and the person she wants to say thank you to.

Yoshioka Mayu as Iizaka Mahiro

**\-- Can you give a brief introduction about your character, [Iizaka Mahiro (飯坂真尋)](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/iizaka_mahiro)?**

**Yoshioka Mayu (Yoshioka):** She's an onsen musume from Fukushima Prefecture. People may know of Iizaka for the Iizaka Kenkamatsuri (飯坂けんか祭り) and in that regard, she's more of a spirited and rowdy girl with a tendency of taking care of others. I enjoy portraying headstrong characters so I'm having fun voicing her.

**\-- Since _Onsen Musume_ is an idol project that aims to bring smiles and joy to people through song and dance, do you enjoy singing and dancing?**

**Yoshioka:** I do and it's something I've been doing for a long time and it feels sad now that I won't be doing it as much anymore. I want to showcase the skills I've developed whenever I can, especially singing. Just getting to do that makes me happy.

**\-- Can you share an experience you had in Fukushima prefecture?**

**Yoshioka:** I went there last year for an event in Koriyama City on March 11 \[For WUG Solo Live Tour 2018\]. It was a very memorable day. It was still cold in Fukushima yet everyone was warm, welcoming, and holding strong, and the food was delicious. I also went to Iwaki City for an _Onsen Musume_ event in Spa Resort Hawaiians, a place I never considered going since I'm not from there. I'm grateful for those activities because it turned into an opportunity for me to explore and learn about Fukushima. It's a beautiful place and I want to go back there again someday, maybe even plan a trip to Iizaka Onsen in my own time.

(\*This interview was conducted before the _Onsen Musume_ event in Iizaka Onsen for September 14 was announced.)

**\-- That sounds fun!**

**Yoshioka:** I don't know if I can just show up out of the blue so I have to make some inquiries first. (laughs) But I want to make the trip, especially because it has a hot spring.

**\-- Do you like hot springs?**

**Yoshioka:** I do. Sometimes I go out of my way to get off on stations that have foot baths nearby just to soak. There's actually one in Onagawa Station in Miyagi Prefecture. It underwent renovation due to the Tohoku Earthquake and it looks so beautiful now. I love foot baths. Especially during cold seasons, there’s a strange appeal in just feeling the warmth on my feet.

**\--Now that you're part of _Onsen Musume_ and will be doing idol activities all over the country, I want to ask your opinion about it or about idols in general.**

**Yoshioka:** I wasn't fond of idols when I was starting out as a voice actress but that gradually changed as I found myself portraying an idol character and did those kinds of activities over the years. I didn't know how much work it took going to events and live shows to perform in front of an audience and create an atmosphere that unites everyone. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that you can't continue being an idol if you don't fully believe in what you're doing.

**\-- You came to that realization through your experience of portraying an idol character?**

**Yoshioka:** Yes. I’ve come to respect them now.

**\-- It sounds like you're aiming to bring that experience and mindset to _Onsen Musume'_s activities.**

**Yoshioka:** That's what I'm hoping to do.

**\-- Speaking of which, one of those activities is _Tsuishin, arigatou_, which had just finished recording. In your own words, what do you think about it?**

**Yoshioka:** It seemed a difficult song to pull off when I first listened to the melody. It's a mid-tempo ballad, which makes it hard to impart emotions to it, but the rhythm wasn't complicated and gave it a perfect balance. People have told me there’s a always a way to approach compositions like these so I felt motivated to give it a shot.

**\-- How did it go?**

**Yoshioka:** The session went for about an hour and a half. We could have finished in thirty minutes, which was the fastest I've personally done, but we took our time to do retakes until we were satisfied.

**\-- What were you feeling as you listened to it?**

**Yoshioka:** It reminded me about the power of letters, and how important it is to impart words of gratitude into your singing. Since this is supposed to be sung by characters from regions that had been hit by earthquake disasters, the feelings and sentiments it expressed felt more impactful.

\[Mayu's first solo song, _Tegami_, was written in a similar manner. She wrote the lyrics and initially envisioned it as a letter of gratitude addressed to her grandfather who passed away around that time. It was later developed into a letter saying sorry and thank you "to someone important to you."\]

**\--  So it was recorded with the feelings and intentions of the three singers in mind.**

**Yoshioka:** Right. They hope this song imparts a message to everyone that those disasters should never be forgotten.  
  
Also, this is more of a personal thing but I had the pleasure of working with people who had been involved with the project since the beginning—Kodamasaori-san who did the lyrics, the recording crew, the guitarists who did the interlude—They were all very helpful. It’s because of them that this message of gratitude comes across well.

**\-- Since we're in the topic of gratitude, who do you want to say "thank you" right now?**

**Yoshioka:** My mom. I became a voice actress through the WUG audition, but at the time I was actually having serious doubts whether to apply for it. It was my mom who encouraged me and I wouldn't be who I am right now if it weren't for that.

\[According to her final blog and other anecdotes in radio shows, she tried and failed multiple auditions in many different avenues and by the time the WUG audition came around, she was in Tokyo and was having serious doubts about her prospects of getting into the entertainment industry. She thought of that audition as one of her turning points. If she failed, she'd have to reconsider her long-term options. At that point, her confidence was at its lowest, especially her singing, but when she passed the audition, it was the first step for her to realize that maybe she had what it takes.\]

**\-- What do you mean?**

**Yoshioka:** She told me, "Live your life how you want it. You might regret it but it's something you made for yourself. It's yours, after all." Until then, I always followed what my mom thought was best for me but hearing those words somehow felt like I was being let go but at the same time, being encouraged. You could say those words steeled my resolve to take my first step that completely changed my life. So I want to tell her, “Thank you for that.”

\[She describes her relationship with her mother at that time as love-hate. Her mother was a strict mentor who taught her how to sing because she's a great singer who used to be in a band and "couldn't bear to have a daughter who can't sing." Their karaoke sessions usually turned into harsh training sessions which lead to arguments and she grew to hate singing and performing in front of a crowd because, in her words, she never got any compliments. That said, her mother was also a constant source of support as she entered her into numerous auditions and competitions, which eventually lead to the WUG audition.\]

**\-- It’s not a type of advice that just tells you to do your best.**

**Yoshioka:** It felt like I was being pushed away but not abandoned. That somehow, she’s still watching over me.

**\-- You seem to get along well with your family.**

**Yoshioka:** I… guess you can say that. (laughs) My collaborator for this song, Aoyama (Yoshino), has a lot of siblings and she’s very close to her mother. Whenever we get together, I can see how children in our generation come from all sorts of families.  
  
I have a lot of family members who are free-spirited who only get in touch every once in a while to catch up on things. (laughs) Do you know the saying "No news is good news"? That pretty much describes my family household. We’re not too close or too apart from each other.

\[The saying essentially means that you can assume that all is well if there is no news about it.\]

**\-- Your family seems to have a lot of faith in each other.**

**Yoshioka:** I’d like to believe that’s the case. (laughs)

\[Mayu often talks about her family candidly in blogs and shows. She jokingly identifies herself as Half-Osaka and Tokyo since she has family in both places and she basically grew up in both, so much that people get surprised that she's from Osaka. She describes her younger brothers as more responsible and reliable than her with little to no interest in her career (they've never watched her shows live) but would regularly tag along with their mom to visit her in Tokyo to help her clean her room. She has a cousin who often watches her shows, sometimes only telling her after the fact. Her grandfather that she's close to lives in Tokyo and when he passed away, it became one of the inspirations for _Tegami_. Her dad, who she calls "papa" even now, is a pilot (her mother also worked at an airport) who is not always home but would always make time to be there on her birthday.\]

**\-- Actually, I asked the same question to Aoyama-san and she also wanted to say thank you to her mother.**

**Yoshioka:** She did? I can see why.

**\-- How did you figure it out?!**

**Yoshioka:** She wrote a letter to her mom recently. It seems they’ve been keeping in touch more regularly after the earthquake and she’d gotten much closer to her family since then.

**\-- Now that you’re involved with _Onsen Musume_ through this song, what else do you wish to do?**

**Yoshioka:** What I want to do… Does wishful thinking count?

\-- **Sure. (laughs)**

**Yoshioka:** All right. (laughs) I love to sing and dance, singing especially, so I want to keep doing that and maybe tackle a more intense song. Mahiro-chan seems to be an active girl so I want to do a song that gets her pumped up and moving.

**\-- You really love to sing.**

**Yoshioka:** Especially in live shows! The sense of oneness and the moment you create with everyone on a stage is irreplaceable. It’s an experience worth treasuring. You see all sorts of sights at every stage with different people coming to watch you so I’d be glad to see how it is for an _Onsen Musume_ live show.

**\-- It would be interesting to see well-known onsen musume sing folk songs at a festival.**

**Yoshioka:** That would be great. Imagine them doing a Lantern Festival dance. (laughs) There are a lot of characters, which means countless combinations to consider. I rediscovered a lot of good things about Mahiro-chan when we recorded so I want to continue working hard so more people will support _Onsen Musume_.
