Introduction by Tanaka Minami. Originally posted on Twitter. English sub by Punster.

**\-- What did you feel when you learned that you would be this new radio show?**

**Tanaka Minami (TM):** A lot of my fans were left longing since A&G NEXT BREAKS FIVE STARS (FIVE STARS) ended, which was a radio show I’ve been a part of for four and a half years, so I’m grateful to have a new place for them to listen to. The response was so positive when this was announced and I can’t wait to count on their support once more especially the ones who knew of me thanks to FIVE STARS!

**\-- Since FIVE STARS was an hour-long live broadcast, would this be the first time for you to do a pre-recorded show as the sole personality?**

**TM:** As a strictly thirty minute show with variety segments… it might be. In live broadcasts, you get to see listener reactions as they come. It’s obviously not the case here, so I’d like to think of every episode as something that my listeners can kick back and relax to after a long day!

**\-- Could you tell our readers about the concept of the show?**

**TM:** It’s like a once-a-week get together where I welcome listeners to my “house” and talk about what I’ve been doing lately, as well as share some fun and interesting moments. Once time is up though, out they go (laughs). 

**\-- You kick them out?!**

**TM:** At every end of the show, I say “it’s time for all of you to leave.” The house is open only during the show so they would have to leave every time (laughs). That’s something to keep in mind so we won’t forget the fun we had while looking forward to the next one. 

**\-- Did you come up with the title?**

**TM:** I did. I’ve never been good with titles so this involved a lot of thinking. The production staff found it hilarious at first though, but I’m glad they went with it as is! (laughs).

**\-- What’s the reasoning behind it?**

**TM:** The “mina” comes from my name and _minna_, which means everyone. Then I wanted to attach an expression to it that sounds inviting like “come to my house,” but the Japanese for it sounded a little off so I went with “Come on.” Writing in English... isn’t necessarily my thing though, so I put it in hiragana instead. The staff seemed to like that particular detail because I honestly thought they’d use “minahouse” for the email address. Imagine my surprise when I saw “comeon@~” instead (laughs).

**\-- Let’s move on to the variety segments, starting with “Minyami song request!”**

**TM:** I’m a huge fan of character songs so I’d like this to be a place where I can showcase listener song requests. There are a lot of songs out there I’ve yet to know so I’ll learn from it as do my listeners, who also get to hear great music. It’s like hitting two birds with one stone! That and introducing character songs I enjoy to people is something I’ve been wanting to do for a show.

**\-- What character song left a particularly deep impression on you?**

**TM:** Hmm… There’s more than a few but in middle school I used to sing character songs from _Higurashi When They Cry_ a whole lot. I can’t help but be grateful for those songs because they’re probably why I sing them now as a voice actress.

**\-- How about “Minahouse rules”? What kind of segment is it?**

**TM:** It’s where my listeners propose a house rule and I decide whether we follow it or not. In the first episode, I made a rule where “troublemakers have to buy chocolate.” I love chocolate, after all (laughs). My family has a rule… though it’s probably better to call it a custom where we drink something warm like green tea, black tea, or coffee after meals. 

**\-- Does your family have other house rules as well?**

**TM:** Walking our dog whenever he feels like it is probably one. We have a dog potty near our entrance so he would occasionally go there, wags his tail and begs for a walk outside, and who wouldn’t after that display (laughs).

**\-- Sounds like there will be more segments where your listeners can chime in.**

**TM:** The show just started broadcasting so I’m relying on my listeners to bring this “house” to completion. So send in lots of mail. I’ll be waiting for them!

 **-- What are your future plans for the show?**

**TM:** I’d love to hold an event where I record in front of an audience because it would be nice to see their faces while I talk! Actually, I’m enamored by Japanese-style houses. Our house doesn’t have a room like that and I’ve been yearning for that tatami mat smell, so I might just put together a stage with those fixtures (laughs). 

**\-- That’s something for your listeners to look forward to… But would that mean once time’s up...**

**TM:** Yup. Out they go (laughs).
