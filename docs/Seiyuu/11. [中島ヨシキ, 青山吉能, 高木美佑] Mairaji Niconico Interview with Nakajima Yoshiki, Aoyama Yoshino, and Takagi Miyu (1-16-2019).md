**What is Wake Up, Girls! (WUG)?**  

![](/images/5c2b178fd7da12abe0aedc49b7b85e52.png)

_Wake Up, Girls!_ is a 7-person voice acting unit composed of individuals selected from the _2nd Anisong Vocal Audition: “Wake Up, Girls!”_ held by Avex and 81Produce. They are a popular unit that has done multiple national live tours, performed in large-scale events, and its members have starred in both anime and stage plays, among other forms of media.  
  
However, with the announcement of the group disbanding in March 2019, their events are coming to an end.  
  
So for this Niconico Original Interview, I invited Aoyama Yoshino (WUG: Nanase Yoshino) and Takagi Miyu (WUG: Okamoto Miyu) to talk about their new radio show _Minus Ion Tappuri no Healing Radio_ (マイナスイオンたっぷりのヒーリングラジオ) \[Shortened: -MiRaji\]  
  
Also with me is Nakajima Yoshiki (Yamashita Jirou from _THE iDOLM@STER: SideM_), who is the main personality and organizer of the Niconico channel _Yoshiki’s The Create_ (The Create), which will be broadcasting the show.

In this interview, I will ask about rumors pertaining to Aoyama and Takagi’s “complicated friendship”, the details of the show’s Episode 0 where they held an open discussion about the show’s direction, and their opinions and hopes for the new show.

**The Hosts**

* * *

**\-- I'm here to talk about a new show for the Niconico channel** _**The Create**_ **called** _**\-MiRaji**_ **with Nakajima Yoshiki, a popular voice actor who has also helped produce multiple events, radio shows, and live streams. Also with me is Aoyama Yoshino, and Takagi Miyu, who will be the wonderful hosts of this show.  
  
I have a lot of questions to ask so let me begin with the reason why you selected them to be the hosts?**

![](/images/181205-59.jpg)

Nakajima Yoshiki


Nakajima Yoshiki (Nakajima): The straightforward reason, to keep it simple, is that I've worked with them before and I know about them a lot on a personal level.  
  
But if you want more of a serious answer... their activities as part of the unit, Wake Up, Girls! are about to come to an end. I wanted to give them a place to express themselves freely, which I think is important at a time like this.  

Aoyama Yoshino (Aoyama): It certainly came at the right moment. This has been something Miyu and I wanted to do for a long time!  

Takagi Miyu (Takagi): T-That’s so admirable of you….!  

\[Nakajima Yoshiki is also affiliated with 81Produce and has often worked with the WUG members individually for reading dramas, radio shows, etc. He is also part of the 315 production unit S.E.M from _THE iDOLM@STER: SideM_, whose song _Study Equal Magic!_ was performed by Aoyama Yoshino, Takagi Miyu, and Tanaka Minami during Final Tour Part 1’s Karaoke showcase.\]

**\-- And so noble... I think it’s a wonderful gesture a senior would do at a time like this. I imagine their male fanbase might also take interest in the show that you host (Also named** _**The Create**_**) since it has a surprisingly masculine vibe to it.**  

Nakajima: I would appreciate it if they do. My show tries to emulate a smaller version of _"The Tetsuwan DASH!" (ザ！鉄腕！DASH!!)_ which usually involve making ceramics, cooking, among other things, so I'm sure it can appeal to that audience as well.  

**\-- And for Aoyama-san and Takagi-san... in your own words, what did you feel when you they approached you about it?**  

![](/images/181205-221.jpg)

Aoyama: I'm sure Miyu and I feel the same way. We were overjoyed because we've been wanting to do a show with just the two of us for a long time.  
  
And it came right when WUG is ending. We were wondering how we can keep in touch with our fans after that, and just thinking about it makes me feel really lonely. So when _\-MiRaji_ was proposed, I was very grateful because that would give us the opportunity to interact with them again and meet new people along the way.  

Takagi: Like Yoppi (Aoyama’s nickname) said, I'm just as glad. Until now, we've interacted with our fans as WUG but I wanted an opportunity to do so once again in another capacity.  

**Their complicated friendship**  

* * *

**\-- Nakajima-san, what about them appeals most to you?**  

Nakajima: They are very heavy drinkers.  

_(Everyone laughs)_  

Aoyama: No, we're not! Can't you just mention how cute we are?!  

Takagi: Or how hard working we are?!  

![](/images/181205-36.jpg)

Nakajima: I'm pretty sure your fans already know that. (laughs)  

Takagi: (immediate reply) I don't think they do.  

Nakajima: You think so? (laughs)  
  
I can feel how great their chemistry is when they’re together. They’re very comfortable with each other, complement each other well, and it doesn’t feel forced. I want to bring that natural positive vibe to the show.  

Aoyama and Takagi: Wow!  

**\-- Speaking of which, there have been rumors circulating that they have a complicated love-hate relationship...**  

Nakajima: There is that but it wouldn’t have come about if there weren’t good friends in the first place, don’t you think?  

**\-- That’s exactly what I’m trying to figure out. (laughs)**  

Nakajima: I think if they really hated each other, they wouldn’t get along this well. (laughs)  

**\-- So they’re truly good friends and it’s not just a facade?**  

Aoyama: I’m pretty sure that out of all the members, Miyu's the one I eat out with the most. I don't know about her, though.  

Takagi: What are you talking about?! Of course we do.  

Aoyama: How would I know? For all I know, you go out with (Tanaka) Minami and the others just as often but you’re the whole world to me.  

\[Going by the blog, they go out to eat and stay over each other’s places the most. Yoppi wrote that the only times she cleans her place is when Miyu comes by to help her.\]  

**\-- How passionate. (laughs) Speaking of which, I heard that you're notorious for being late all the time, so I was wondering if Takagi-san has accepted that about you.**  

Aoyama: Who told you that!?

![](/images/181205-46.jpg)

_(Everyone laughs)_  

Takagi: It tends to happen a lot when it comes to our personal plans. She never shows up on time. But that's not the case when it comes to work. (laughs)  

Nakajima: And would be bad...  

Aoyama: I really like taking my time. People often scold me to hurry up since I tend to be 30 minutes late.  

**\-- That is quite late.**  

Takagi: And that's why we tease her "Gomiyama Kuzuno" \[Lit: A mountainous pile of trash\]. You like that nickname don’t you?  

Aoyama: Not at all! It just sounds like an insult!  

**\-- It's good to know you're close friends. (laughs)**  

Takagi: Since we're the same age, people also call us "Business Children"  

**\-- Business Children?**  

Takagi: You can think of it as us using our child-like energy to bring excitement instead of being “childish” for the sake of business. (laughs)  

Aoyama: We feel like we’re helping everyone that way.  

\[Business Children came from WUG radio show “All Night Nippon Mobile” and the one that stuck the most. There was also TWiLiGHT (Mayu, Miyu, and Kaya), Charmz (Airi and Nanami), and Moyashitogobou/Moyagobo (Minami and Yoppi). OTA4/オタ4 (Airi, Minami, Miyu, Yoppi) came after.\]  

**\-- ... Does it have actually have anything to do with business though?**  

Takagi: Why... of course it does! What are you trying to say?

Aoyama: I think there are times when you don’t have to act your own age. Like when providing emotional support. There are many situations where you have to act like children to liven up the place!  

Nakajima: Thank you for the insight. Even in our planning discussions, they suggested if they could yell “underpants” repeatedly in the show.  

Aoyama: Well... It would really fun to do.  

_(Everyone laughs)_  

**Plans for the program**

* * *

\-- The show just had an Episode 0 where you discussed with everyone your plans for the show. Since the main intent is for it be a "Healing radio", Nakajima-san, in your honest opinion, do you think they can provide that to its listeners?

Takagi: Yeah, I don’t think listening to us talk is particularly soothing.  

Nakajima: I'd rather want them to go crazy instead of limiting them to lighthearted gimmicks. (laughs)  

When voice actors do a radio show, oftentimes they have to play a character or are restricted by the product they’re representing. I want to give them free rein and let them express themselves however they want.

![](/images/181205-55.jpg)

Takagi: So we can be as reckless as we want as long as our listeners feel better in the end? That’s good to know.  

Aoyama: As long as it’s fine and we don’t forget that it’s a “Healing radio”, I think we can manage!

![](/images/181205-48.jpg)

**\-- Point taken. (laughs) Since we’re on the topic already, can you tell me any grand ideas or ambitions that you have?**  

Aoyama: Hmm... I want to go skydiving.  

Takagi: You’ve been going on about doing that for a long time.  

Aoyama: I started thinking about it 3 years ago but I could never get the chance. I want to experience being up there with everyone on the clear blue sky and feel the wind rushing through us, from our legs down to the tips of our toes.  

**\-- From your legs... to your toes?**  

Takagi: I think you mean head to toe.  

Aoyama: Nope. Only foot to toe, up there in the sky.  

Takagi: Where did the other parts go...  

**\-- How about you, Takagi-san, what do you want to do?**  

Takagi: I want to go out and experience nature. Maybe even do some white water rafting.  

**\-- Rafting?**  

Nakajima: Wouldn't that mess up your makeup?  

Takagi: It's fine! I should do it while I'm still young!  

**\-- I've actually done it before. It can get dangerous since you’re at the mercy of the rapids. Are you sure about doing this?**

Nakajima: Why don’t I note that down...

![](/images/181205-6.jpg)

_(Everyone laughs)_  

Nakajima: And I want you to make camp as well. But only the two of you.  

Takagi: Just like in _Yuru Camp_.

Nakajima: But more rugged. You have to put up a tent, prepare meals, and spend the night all by yourselves.

Takagi: I’m game! There's a thing called a tree tent and I want to try sleeping in one.  

![](/images/91VSv1P-2JL._SL1200_.jpg)

(image from Amazon) A tree tent is a type of tent that is secured in mid-air via ropes tied to surrounding trees. Can they actually set this up...


Aoyama: Just the two of us? But won't we have staff nearby just in case anything happens?  

Nakajima: Of course! They'll be there to catch footage... though I wonder what’ll happen if they realize they can't use any of it.  

Takagi: That would be for the best. (laughs) In any case, I really want to do that someday.  

**Healing Radio**

* * *

**\-- Since it's a "Healing radio", will it have segments where you talk about concerns and worries?**  

Nakajima: We have segments like that planned but what do you mean by that?  

**\-- I mean, for example, I want to talk about something concerning my friend. I was thinking if maybe Aoyama-san and Takagi-san can ease some of those worries.**  

Takagi: Oh, what is it?

![](/images/181205-181.jpg)

**\-- He recently quit as a freelancer and started working at a company and he’s not looking too good and he’s only been there for two weeks…**  

Aoyama: Really? People like that usually end up quitting.  

Takagi: You should throw your drink at him. Like, “Here’s some coffee, take this!”  

**\-- Huh?**  

Nakajima: That sounds pretty extreme… But I think it’s fine since there is more than one way to solve a problem, and you don’t have to be gentle and considerate either. (laughs)  

**\-- Well, that might encourage him to work harder the next day.**  

Takagi: I know the world has full of difficulties but I want to create one where everyone can face them with a smile.  

Nakajima: That’s quite idealistic.  

Takagi: I know we have our own personal circumstances to consider but I think it would be great if we are capable of laughing at everything that comes our way.  

Aoyama: We probably might have listeners who will tune in to our show and start feeling better about their lives, right?  

Nakajima: You mean those who might have given up on life already? (laughs)  

Aoyama: I didn’t mean it that way. (laughs). But I do think that conversations like these are more productive if you can weigh in both positive and negative extremes.

**Nakajima Yoshiki Behind-the-scenes**

* * *

\-- Let's switch topics and focus on Nakajima-san. On top of your work as a voice actor, you're also spearheading _The Create_ as the main person-in-charge. What inspired you to do behind-the-scenes work like this?

![](/images/181205-57.jpg)

Nakajima: _The Create_ started as a channel involving Me, Shimizu-san (producer), Shinozaki-san (organizer), and my manager. Basically, we just get together somewhere, record something, and broadcast it.  
  
But since Shimizu-san has had a lot of experience doing video shows, Shinozaki-san handled radio shows before, and I have experience hosting them, I figured maybe we can create something substantial and it developed from there.  

**\-- So you’re saying that because it is a team composed only of a few members, everyone has to be skilled in some regard.**  

Nakajima: Something like that. Since it’s our program, I wanted to be completely hands-on throughout the whole process.  

**\-- In a sense, this channel is a way to express yourselves. Since the channel also has two ongoing shows at the moment\* and with _\-MiRaji_ as the newest addition, I want to ask you about how it’s scheduling**

\*The two ongoing shows are _Nakajima Yoshiki’s The Create (中島ヨシキのザックリエイト)_ and _Komada Wataru and Amami Yurina’s Marine Studio (Marista) (駒田航と天海由梨奈のマリスタ！)_ \[Incidentally, they’re all from 81Produce\])

Nakajima: Since there are 4 weeks in a month and the 1st and 3rd Fridays are already scheduled for _The Create_ and _Marista_ for the 4th, I realized that it left the 2nd Friday open for anything. (laughs)  

I started to get the feel for managing the channel and figured out the ropes of creating programs. So I wanted to take this opportunity to be a bit unconventional and challenge myself by doing something new.  

**Future Prospects**

* * *

**\-- Finally, I want to ask about your plans for the future. I'll start with Nakajima-san, what do you want to aim to do next for the channel?**  

Nakajima: We mentioned this before but as one of our plans for 2019, we will be producing a drama CD. I'm still slowly ironing out the story details but I'll do my best to make it something marketable.

![](/images/181205-31.jpg)

Aoyama: You're writing all of it yourself?  

Nakajima: I have experience doing it since I’ve written scripts for stage plays before. I know this project can't be done alone but The Create's main concept is "Making what you want through your own efforts”. So for now, I want to embody that ideal and turn my ideas into reality while also making it something worth enjoying.  

Takagi: You just started making your own music as well.  

Aoyama: And you’ve already written a lot of song lyrics.  

\[Nakajima Yoshiki and Kento Itou currently make up a 2-person unit called UMAKE where they make their own music. Kento is mainly the composer, Nakajima the lyricist.\]  

**\-- I imagine this drama CD would also involve the other personalities in the channel.**  

Nakajima: We're still on the planning stages, but I’ve come far enough that I feel motivated to finish it. I’ve been meaning to hold auditions in other agencies as well.  

Takagi: Maybe we won’t even have a chance...  

Aoyama: Oh no. Let’s just do what we can.  

**\-- Cheer up! (laughs) Didn't you achieve your long-awaited dream of making a radio show?**  

Takagi: We did! We had a planning episode (Episode 0) and I can really feel it coming together. It was a lot of fun, so I'm confident the regular program will be as well. We’ll do our best to make each episode a success so look forward to _\-MiRaji_!  

Aoyama: I'm very glad that we finally get to do a radio show. I’m sure we’ll face many different challenges since it’s something different from WUG, but I would like to share that experience with everyone. And also as part of _The Create_, I want to think of this as a place for me to grow.  

**\-- Thank you. Nakajima-san, as the one spearheading this project, any final words.**  

Nakajima: There are a lot of radio shows that feature voice actors, but _The Create_ is unique in that it’s something only I could have created. That’s also the same for Komada Wataru and Amami Yurina with _Marista_. I want to produce a show with these two because I saw in them a unique appeal and sense of fun that I want to share with everyone.  
  
Moving forward, I want to do events where we can go out and personally interact with our listeners so look forward to that!  

**\-- I'm excited to see what kind of show _\-MiRaji_ will be. Thank you for coming in for this interview!**
