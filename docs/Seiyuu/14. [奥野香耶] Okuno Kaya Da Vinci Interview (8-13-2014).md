**\-- Can you tell me about your character Sasame Yaya in _Hanayamata_****.**  

Okuno Kaya (OK): She completely adores the lead character, Naru (CV: Ueda Reina)! (laughs) She got into yosakoi (a Japanese dance style) because she was being protective of her but she's actually in a band and doesn't actually care much for it...  

**\-- She must really care for her, then. (laughs)**  

OK: She does. (laughs) I think she's someone who struggles with a lot of internal conflicts. She shares a long history with Naru, her best friend since grade school. When she discovered that she befriended a total stranger, Hana (CV: Tanaka Minami), she started feeling scared and insecure that they're drifting apart so she decided to try and understand what made her become interested in yosakoi.  

**\-- On that note, how about you? Have you also felt jealous for the same reason?**  

OK: I have. Anyone would feel jealous if they see their friend together with someone else, especially if that friend is someone they want to be closer to. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it’s easy for someone like Yaya-chan to let Naru know about her insecurity...

**\-- I guess her inability to let her true emotions be felt makes her a tsundere?**  

OK: Yes. Though lately, she's becoming more like a yandere! I always wanted to portray those kinds of characters so I'm glad I get to voice her! I love Yaya-chan so much. I love how she looks and she has an adorable personality. Whenever I see her on TV, I can't help but feel compelled to fawn at her. (laughs) Words can't express how happy I am that I’m actually voicing her. I was so unsure about auditioning for her, so it feels like fate brought us together. (laughs) I mean, we have similar names (Yaya and Kaya) and even the staff had called me Okuno Yaya on some occasions. (laughs)

**\-- Going back a bit, can you tell me about the anime _Wake Up, Girls!_****and your character Kikuma Kaya?**  

OK: It is set in Sendai and Kaya's is a girl that has gone through a lot of pain. She lost her best friend to the Tohoku Earthquake and to deal with the trauma, she left her hometown of Kesennuma for Sendai, where she enrolled in a vocational school. She had no friends and lived alone while working a job. She didn’t know what to do with her life but found her purpose in becoming an idol, where she decided to change herself and take a step forward.

**\-- The members share names (but with different kanji), physical features, and even some personal backgrounds with their anime counterparts. I want to know if you were like Kaya-chan, who had to do a make-or-break decision to achieve her dream?**  

OK: Yes. I always wanted to become a voice actress but it’s easier said than done. So on my final year of college, before I would have to find a job, I learned of the audition and decided to give it a final go. If I failed, I would give up on it for good.  

\[Kaya did a gap year in college due to a medical issue which required her to take the whole year off. She spent 2013 finishing her thesis about _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ then graduated in 2014.\]  

**\-- What do you mean by "easier said than done"?**  

OK: When I was in high school, I told my parents that I wanted to enroll at a voice acting academy and they asked why. I don't talk much at home so I couldn’t convince them and eventually just gave up on the idea. But looking back, I'm very happy it worked out that way because I got to attend the university I wanted and still got to achieve my dream.  

\[Long story explanation since this is a recurring Kaya story:  
  
Kaya wanted to become a voice actress, but would often keep to her room and watch anime while practicing voice work by mimicking all the characters' voices and performances. But due to her personality and her family just leaving her be, she kept it so well that nobody in her family was even aware of it until she was about to graduate high school. She told her mother she wanted to enroll in a voice acting academy but her mom refused when she couldn't explain why. She told her to "be more realistic", and Kaya regretted not standing up for herself and prove that she didn't just decide it on a whim.  
  
She later stated that it all worked out well for her in the end because she got in the same university as her sister and found a degree she enjoyed, that if she failed the audition or if being a voice actress didn't work out, she has a plan B.  
  
Oddly enough, she also remarked that, before the audition, her parents would scold her for keeping anime merchandise, asking when she would throw them out, but would later enable her _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ obsession when they learned that she passed.\]  

**\-- When did it sink in that you’ve finally become a voice actress?**  

OK: When I saw an anime character speaking with my voice, it was like I got transported into another world! I was so happy. I truly felt that my dream came true.

**\-- It sounds like everyone in WUG got to achieve their dreams. Since you’ve been working for the WUG anime since passing your audition, how did it feel when the broadcast was over?**  

OK: I often get asked what the WUG anime is for me and my answer is usually, "It's our debut work." I see it as our origin and a stepping stone. Actually, I didn't think my character resembled me in any way at first. She has a low tone of voice and I certainly don't look like her, not to mention everyone else resembled theirs in a way. (laughs) But now that the anime finished airing, I came to realize how much of a perfect fit she is. I discovered and came to appreciate our similarities, like the fact that we both tend to suppress our emotions. In fact, I was hesitant when they told me I can use my natural voice for Yaya in _Hanayamata_.

**\-- A short anime series, _WUG ZOO_****, was just announced recently. Can you tell us about it?**  

OK: It feels like a season 1.5 of the anime series but set in a zoo. I play my image animal, an alligator, but it's not a costume, but an actual alligator. (laughs) She’ll probably end up eating all sorts of stuff. (laughs) What I think is something to worth looking out for is the dark and morbid humor the show has.  

**\-- I'm excited to see your performance in Anisama!**  

OK: Me too! I’m nervous, though. I watched last year's digest video and the performers were surrounded by the audience and their light sticks. It's hard to imagine us being on a stage like that. I wonder what we’ll see. I feels like an emotional moment for me since my favorite band, Mr. Children, stood on that same stage.  

**\-- By the way, Team Hanayamata (Composed of Ueda Reina, Tanaka Minami, Okuno Kaya,** **Ō****tsubo Yuka, Nakamura Manami) is a unit established to sing opening theme for the anime. How does that group compare to WUG?**  

OK: I've been with the members of WUG ever since we passed the audition. We share the same dream in becoming voice actresses and work hard to achieve it. We see each other as friends and rivals as we help each other and aim for the top. On the other hand, Team Hanayamata is composed of voice actresses that I look up to. There’s always something to learn whenever I get to be with them. Especially Nakamura-san; just watching her work is a treat. The other day, I was able to talk to her and Koyama Tsuyoshi-san (Masaru Ōfuna) when they invited us for yakiniku and it was a lot of fun!  

**\-- Now for some personal questions. You mentioned before that you’re a fan of Mr. Children, what song of theirs is your favorite?**  

OK: Hmm… It’s hard to pick one. How about my top three which would be _Bird cage_, _渇いたkiss (Kawaita kiss)_, and _幸せのカテゴリー(Shiawase no Category)_. Oh, _Pink～奇妙な夢 (Pink~Kimyou na Yume)_ deserves a special mention as well. That song is very emotional, and it’s mellow ambient melody makes it an easy listen.

**\-- Do you sing their songs in karaoke?**  

OK: I sing _渇いたkiss_, though I’m happy enough just listening to their songs. (laughs) I sing a lot of anime songs, usually those by Nagi Yanagi, Hirano Aya, and such. I also sing songs from _Neon Genesis Evangelion_ such as _Soul Refrain_. I tend to tear up whenever I sing it because the video shows scenes from _The End of Evangelion_, especially that fateful scene with Misato. (laughs) When I was in college, I used to go on 8-hour karaoke sessions by myself. (laughs)

**\-- Do you still do that on your days off?**  

OK: I haven’t gone to karaoke lately. My days off are quite boring. I just lock myself in my room and sleep all day. (laughs) I don’t even go out to the convenience store right across my apartment. (laughs) Normally I just buy some snacks to eat for tomorrow and I spend the next day waking up, eating snacks, sleeping, then suddenly it’ll be 10 PM and my mom will message me good luck for tomorrow, then I go back to sleep. (laughs) Maybe I just love sleeping. (laughs)  

\[She has since written that she spends some of those days binging Western TV series and movies like Criminal Minds and Kung-fu Panda. On more than one occasion, she writes about the dreams she had with the characters.\]

**\-- What kind of snacks do you like?**  

OK: I love potato chips especially lightly salted Pringles! I take a few that I place on top of the lid and I take my time eating them one by one.

**\-- What are your sleeping habits, if I may ask?**  

OK: I can’t sleep unless I’m pressed against a wall but I always tend to hit it as I roll around, so my hair is a mess by the time I wake up. (laughs) My hair is thin so it tangles easily. When I asked our makeup artist about it the other day, she also thinks it’s because I’m a restless sleeper. (laughs)  

\[The other reason why "loves walls" is that they’re silent and always there to support her.\]  

**\-- Can you tell me a recent story where you struggled?**  

OK: I had a moment of revelation during _Hanayamata_'s recording. There was a scene where Yaya-chan violently spits out her drink after hearing a joke. I couldn’t get the expression right so I ended up staying overtime. It was frustrating since I wanted to show how capable I am. That’s when I realized the good parts between me and Yaya-chan and began to understand her better, and my approach to portraying her changed as a result.  

**\-- Finally, can you tell me what kind of projects do you want to be part of as a voice actress!**

OK: I want to be involved in all sorts of projects. My dream is to collect figurines of characters I voice and display them in my room. (laughs) Of course, Kikuma Kaya will always be front and center. I want to try voicing a character like Ayanami Rei. She’s a mysterious character who can be sometimes transparent, sometimes vacant, and sometimes profound. I want to become a voice actress that can surprise people and make them wonder what kind of voice I’ll bring.
