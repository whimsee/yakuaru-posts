**I think of ways to make the project exciting as a whole.**

* * *

**\-- You landed several main roles for new anime in 2018. If we go back to Seiyuu Grand Prix’s November 2015 edition, specifically the “Future plans” feature article, you talked about many of your career goals in the future.**

**Takahashi Rie (TR):** It’s been so long since then! Looking back, a lot of things have changed. A recent surprise is being the host of a live cooking show called _Takahashi Rie no Konban Nani Tsukuro? (高橋李依の今晩なにつくろ?)..._ It feels as if I was specifically chosen to do it since it’s a program meant to showcase the improvement of someone who doesn’t really cook. (laughs) The viewer comments have been a huge help in helping me remember what not to do, though. For instance, basic fundamental things anyone should know such as not sampling raw meat. (laughs)

It’s really fun, I have to say, and it’s not often I get work opportunities that teach me new skills so getting to do that is great.

**\-- You’re doing more live programs and radio shows as well.**

**TR:** Speaking of talk shows, I get to speak with different guests each episode for _Re: Radio Life in a different world from zero_, which probably got me a lot of experience and insight into doing them. It fascinated me that my role is to draw out questions our listeners might want to ask the guest each and every week. And lately, I’ve been thinking about how to make these talks and events interesting and exciting so the work could shine as a whole.

**\-- Is that why there’s a segment called “****_Shota Suki na Ichimen” (ショタ好きな一面） in Fate/Grand Order Chaldea Radio Station_****?**

**TR:** Exactly. (laughs) For long-running shows, I tend to worry if I should continue strictly sticking to my role as a voice actress embodying a role, or take a few liberties at my expense. It’s to make the show more enjoyable, after all… Honestly though, I wanted to keep that side of me a secret! (laughs)

If someone were to tell me it broke their image of the character, I’d feel sorry because it can be a bit too much hearing someone with a similar voice going crazy about shotas… Thankfully, the listeners are very receptive to it, and seeing comments from people who say that they’re willing to do anything for the show warms my heart.

**\-- Aside from radio shows, you seem to be flourishing in your primary role as a voice actress. You said in your “Future plans” that you’d be very busy by 2016.**

**TR:** It was quite a fruitful year when I started working on fantastic series such as _KonoSuba_ in January, _Maho Girls PreCure!_ in February, and _Re:Zero_ in April.

**\-- For a delightfully wacky show like _Konosuba_, I’m wondering if it’s particularly demanding in terms of acting.**

**TR:** It has a lot of things I don’t usually encounter in other shows, but the sound team being there to provide commentary gives you an idea of what they really want out of you in that environment.

If the scene involved multiple cast members talking simultaneously, it would have to be recorded separately and later edited in, but the novelty of the lines would get lost once we say them over and over again with no pause. So during the short time between the test and main recording, they would pick test takes that were good enough with some polish because they wanted us to perform them as few as possible. That gave me the impression that this wonderful team that I’m working with was brought together because they know what’s best for _KonoSuba_.

**It’s a true delight always getting to work in such environments**

* * *

**\-- You mentioned back then that by 25, you wished to have voiced a kids anime. With** **_Maho Girls PreCure!,_** **I’d say you cleared that goal much sooner.**

**TR:** And I’m Pink, the lead character \[Asahina Mirai\]! \[ (laughs) It’s a funny connection too since Asano Masumi, who helped me a lot in my first lead role in _Seiyu's Life!_, starred in the previous series _Go! Princess PreCure,_ and I’ve met Horie Yui as a guest cameo in _Seiyu’s Life!._ I was wracking my head silly trying to calm down and process it because if I look at it in terms of my career history, it’s like something out of _Cinderella_. (laughs)

I feel grateful that I’ve been given these opportunities to work with cast members who love their work so much, they’re willing to do anything for it. As the cast lead, I actually wanted to act more serious, but being Asahina Mirai, who occasionally becomes a Pretty Cure, I had to focus on tackling both sides of her.

**\-- So you didn’t have that eagerness one would have as a cast lead.**

**TR:** I thought that with our partner roles, if Horie Yui’s the moon I would have to be the sun, but it was more like I was a sunflower freshly bloomed from the ground. (laughs) Actually, I’d say I grew thanks to everyone, especially Saitou Ayaka (Mofurun) who shined in the studio, and the refreshing wind who was Hayami Saori (Cure Felice).

It’s been more than a year since the show finished airing but we still got together for a Halloween party wearing matching parkas that we made with the staff. It’s crazy to think that it happened in spite of our busy schedules!

**\-- That anecdote sounds much like the heartwarming series that made it happen.**

**TR:** Our team had more than enough smiles to give… It even rubbed off on me, as someone who lacks self-confidence; being a part of this wonderful series gave me confidence. When we visited a shrine to pray for _Teasing Master Takagi-san_’s success, I was happy to hear that the head priest's daughter's first anime was _Maho Girls PreCure!_. It was touching to think that my work could help young girls learn and grow well.

**\-- You also mentioned before that you wanted to voice a young boy protagonist by 35. You’ve achieved that as well with** **_Knight's & Magic_****!**

**TR:** Yes, I have. (laughs) It’s very hard for female voice actors to voice characters who pilot robots so setting that as my goal was ambitious to say the least, but I’m so glad I pulled it off! 

Eru was a sweet little boy who started getting more intense shouting scenes halfway through the show, and the enemies he faced off against were all voiced by more experienced male voice actors. But I didn’t want to let that discourage me and my voice in standing toe to toe against theirs, so I dug real deep and took on the challenge.

**\-- Since we’re on the topic of competitiveness,** **_Keijo!!!!!!!!_** **comes to mind.**

**TR:** Oh yeah! I love the series, so going all-out on it was so fun. We’d have thoughtful conversations about the right way to call a butt, and it was a frantic environment where we have guest actors who get puzzled about delivering certain lines with a straight face.

But the cast members who have been at it since episode one have built up quite a tolerance to it that they don’t just burst out laughing mid-session. I personally can’t contain my laughter, so working on this certainly got me to do it. (laughs)

**It’s not just giving it your all, I also want to learn how to step back**

* * *

**\-- Recently, you’ve been portraying cool and composed characters like Misaki from _Battle Girl High School._**

**TR:** She's a character who was introduced in the anime, and was later added to the game. It was interesting that I was picked for that role among other cast members who have fully fleshed out their respective characters. I only learned her backstory midway through recording so I was only a little ahead from the people watching the show.

So initially, my acting had to be where I made an assumption and then “added parts” to it as I learned more about her. She might be the role from last year that I thought about the most. 

**\-- Are you someone whose acting is based on logic?**

**TR:** I believe that in order to act with emotion, you have to start by approaching it logically. You extract and consider the aspects that make a given character, and see how it all comes together during a recording session. _Then_ you put your emotions into it. (laughs)

For instance, Megumin from _KonoSuba_. You could classify her as a “loli girl” character, but she has a quick temper and is highly intelligent. You have to consider those aspects because they make up who she is.

For Emilia from _Re:Zero_, you’d certainly think from the first episode that she’s your classic heroine that has to be protected. But she’s not. She was out in the streets by that point yet she doesn’t know how to interact with people, let alone the ways of the world. So during that intriguing acting process of adding and taking out parts, you figure out that she’s not that kind of heroine. You have to keep in mind what things in the story she knows and doesn’t know and it can be tough… That kept me on my toes each episode.

**\-- As an actor, does this constant pursuit for difficult challenges play a part when making great strides?**

**TR:** I believe it’s getting to portray characters that are completely out of your comfort zone and being in a supportive environment. Because when you have supportive people around who tell you how much they like the characters you voice, you start believing it too. (laughs) I’m delighted that I can take pride in all the characters I’ve portrayed!

**\-- You’re voicing a variety of roles in several shows that started airing this January.**

**TR:** I’ve been a big fan of _Teasing Master Takagi-san_ ever since I voiced Takagi-san for a promotional video, but... I tempered that feeling because while I was confident it was going to get an anime adaptation someday, it might not take it well if I wasn’t called to audition for it.

But on the other hand, I also thought that _should_ be reason enough to give it my all so I wouldn’t have any regrets. Takagi-san and I have barely anything in common, so it always played in the back of my mind. Or rather, part of me couldn’t help but be conscious of it (laughs) but I promise to do her justice.

\[She has since sung as Takagi-san as a surprise guest in _Animelo Summer Live 2019_\]

Teasing Master Takagi-san PV #1 (2017)

**\-- You’re also voicing Saito Ena in** **_Laid-Back Camp_****, a staple series of** **_Manga Time Kirara_****!**

**TR:** And also Katsuki Tsubasa from their other series, _Comic Girls_, which will start airing in April. Somehow, I always get short-haired characters. (laughs) But that gives me confidence I can portray her well! Those kinds of characters tend to be easy to get along with but I wouldn’t go so far as to call it a trope because Saito-san is free-spirited while Tsubasa-chan is heavily obsessed with shōnen manga. Both have their own charming idiosyncrasies.

What really surprised me lately was that I got cast as Ameno Sagiri for _Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs_. Auditioning for her felt like taking an entrance exam and not expecting to pass because I’m just not that type of girl. But things happen for a reason, and this year I’m hoping experiences like these get me to branch out further.

**\-- Lately, we’ve been seeing more voice actors pursue singing careers. Have you ever wanted to debut as a solo artist?**

**TR:** I have a lot of aspirations but that one’s probably not for me. (laughs) I’m part of a group called _Earphones_ where it’s more of a producer’s vision that we bring to life. I feel that it’s suited for me because I get to give all my focused effort for the group as a whole.

That said, I love character songs and I enjoy singing while assuming a role. I feel honored to be Shika in _The Idolmaster_, a series I’ve always wished to be a part of, and I never expected I’d ever voice a character in a rival position… She’s brilliant on stage and I wonder what it would be like if we could perform together, especially that I like wearing flashy outfits. (laughs)

**\-- Finally, tell us your goals for the future.**

**TR:** The previous feature article mentioned that I wanted to do voice narrations by the time I’m 60. I haven’t cleared that yet so I’ll keep at it until I do.

Also… I’m bad at taking myself out of a role. (Kayano) Ai was an expert at it when we were recording KonoSuba and she gave me advice on how to take care of myself. I get too into my work and the roles I play as, which I think is both my strongest and weakest quality. I don’t want to make compromises, rather I want to know where I’m at on a given day so I can do my best work. I’ll keep pushing forward so I’d appreciate your warm support. Thank you so much!

**Trivia questions**

**In one word, how would you describe your personality?**

It feels a bit embarrassing to say to but I’d call myself “serious” and “hardworking.”

**What brings you joy?**

I got to wear western-style clothes for this photoshoot and I was thrilled that their pattern is somewhat out there! You see a lot of well-dressed voice actors in recording sessions, and it kind of makes me want to do the same because it hit me that if I’m noticing what they wear, they’re probably doing the same to me. (laughs) So lately, I’m enjoying fashionable things. 

**Are you friends with any actors?**

**The internet says I’m good friends with Ueda Reina and Aisaka Yūka, which is true. (laughs) Recently, I’ve gotten real close with Ōhashi Ayaka. I’m starting to think that most of my friends are generally ones who talk at an easygoing pace. I talk fast so that’s probably why a lot of them are good listeners. (laughs)**

What’s your bad habit that you can’t seem to break?

A: I don’t know why but for bottled drinks, I always save a tiny bit of its contents for later! I’d think that maybe I’ll drink from it again and notice it as I throw it away… Actually, I see a bottle in front of me right now and there’s barely anything left in it. (laughs)

* * *

**More trivia questions**. **The premise here is that each one starts from a kana of her name**

**\[TAKARA\] Q: What do you TREASURE?**

**A: All the works I’ve been a part of and characters I’ve portrayed so far.**

**\[KARAOKE\] Q: What song do you often sing in KARAOKE?**

**A: Lately, I’ve been practicing** **_Shikisai_** **(色彩). I admire Sakamoto Maaya’s wordplay, and getting to sing her words well feels great!**

**\[HAJIMETE\] Q: What “FIRST experience” do you remember vividly?**

**A: Stealth games. I had a blast being a spy, sneaking around patrolling guards, and avoiding infrared sensors.** 

**\[She’s most likely referring to the Real Escape room-type stealth games such as the one below\]**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1GsCH8giPE

**\[SHŪKAN\] Describe a HABIT that you have?**

**A: I eat my character’s favorite food before I portray them. So I eat curry if it’s Misaki from** **_Battle Girl High School,_** **freshly baked bread if it’s Mash from** **_Fate/Grand Order_****… and so on.**

**\[RYOKOU\] If you were to TRAVEL, where would you go?**

**A: Overseas since I haven’t traveled in quite some time. Europe would be good since it’s like** **_Re:Zero_****’s setting!**

**\[EIKYOU\] Who are your INFLUENCES?**

**A: I have many! But if I were to single out a few, it would be my mother, who’s a great listener especially when I worry. And my dad, who sends me messages that dissect those worries. (laughs)**

* * *

**Top Three Things**

**1\. Voice actors. I’m a big fan of the industry so I simply love voice actors! That one I’ll never budge on. (laughs)**

**2\. Twitter. I feel like tweeting about something every day. I don’t really blog all that much and Twitter feels more my pace. It also feels like always having a place nearby where people support you.**

**3\. 100-yen shops. Those places have everything so if you take me there, make sure to block off at least an hour off your schedule! (laughs) You can buy anything and do all sorts of things with them. And the best part is if it doesn’t work out, it’s so cheap, it can’t really hurt!**
