**\-- Looking at these pictures, it seems like you've gotten used to doing photo shoots.**

Aoyama Yoshino (AY): I want to say, "Oh... Indeed, I have!" but really, I'm not good at doing solo shoots. It's fine when it's all of us since we're trying our best to look cute. But solo... Nope! (laughs) I'm slowly getting used to it, at least.

**\-- You also seem to be more refined since you entered college last year. How has it been since then?**

AY: It's not the easiest way to go about things but I've been taking classes that sound interesting to me. It’s great but I also end up writing down nonsense answers in exams when I get flustered and fail to understand the question.

**\-- How about living alone since you also moved to Tokyo when you enrolled.**

AY: I just had a thought about that recently... The more you devote yourself to work, the harder it is to be feminine. It's so tough! Back then, I didn't have to buy my own everyday supplies, so I spent it on western clothes and shoes and such. But now there are times when I happen upon something cute that I want to buy then realize that I also have to buy cleaning supplies, which means more stuff to carry... It's like I'm becoming less of a girl nowadays.

**\-- It’s part of living alone, though.**

AY: There's more to life than that! That’s why I try to bring in some color. I fill my room with all sorts of cute stuff and I have a wall devoted to manga ready to welcome me whenever I get home. It makes it all worthwhile.

**\-- Do you put up posters as well?**

AY: I've gone overboard in my room at my parents' house. The walls were covered with posters from _Expelled from Paradise_, _Touken Ranbu_, and such. It was hard having to part with them. I even had a _Durarara!!_ calendar!

**\-- How about cooking? Do you cook for yourself?**

AY: Nope! I eat out.

**\-- How was the previous year for you with all the excitement and events surrounding the release of the two sequel movies?**

AY: It made me realize once again how great _Wake up, Girls!_ is. _Beyond the Bottom_ hit pretty close to home, especially my own circumstances and how I’ve been approaching WUG activities and voice acting work, which wouldn't have been possible in the first place if it weren't for WUG. It's pretty thought-provoking.

**\-- Now that you can freely talk about it, can you tell me any interesting stories that happened in the story or impressions you had during recording?**

AY: It was cool to see how much everyone improved when we recorded for _Shadow of Youth_ (_Seishun no Kage_). Objectively speaking, they've gained so much experience working in different places and you could see clearly that they've come into their own as voice actresses, which honestly left me feeling frustrated. Of course, we all started at different skill levels but we all debuted at the same time and attended the same classes...

**\-- But being in Kumamoto simply limited the kinds of auditions you could apply for, didn’t it?**

AY: Yes but I don't want to make excuses. I can already imagine Director Yamamoto scolding me, saying that I'm just being stubborn... He's the kind of person who would say that. So I want to hear that voice say I can do well despite my lack of experience!

![](/images/sp-1604122300-05.jpg)

**\-- How did it turn out?**

AY: ... I was called in after we finished recording for _Shadow of Youth_. I've already cried at that point and I knew why. I was just very frustrated. Thinking about it now, I felt the exact same way the girls did in the movie and it connected me to Yoshino-chan’s feelings all the more. We were at our lowest point and had so much to overcome.

**\-- And I imagine you were able to project those feelings into your performance.**

AY: Probably. There's no one true way to approach acting, after all, and it'll only get more challenging the deeper you get into it.

**\-- How was the dub recording for** **_Beyond the Bottom_****?**

AY: When was that again?

**\-- It should be before last year's tour began since we took interviews after recording for it just finished.**

AY: Oh! Yeah. I remember going to see Nagazato-san’s \[baseball\] game at the MetLife Dome after that. (laughs)

**\-- R-right. It should be more than half a year ago.**

AY: I can’t believe it’s been that long. I can’t necessarily say if my acting improved since then but my approach to portraying Yoshino-chan did change. Until then, I was being conscious of what Yoshino-chan would do. This time, I focused instead on what I would do. _Beyond the Bottom_ focuses on Nanami's character who also shares the same dream of becoming a singer when she joined WUG. Taking that approach would make it easier for me to visualize.

**\-- What’s the difference between the two?**

AY: I get to act naturally. Once I have it noted in my script, it gave me something to work with as I put myself in Yoshino-chan’s shoes. I think being able to do that now is a small measure of improvement for me.

![](/images/sp-1604122300-08.jpg)

**\-- I think the movie also presents a chance for Yoshino-chan to redeem herself from the incident where she sprained her ankle in previous Idol Festival.**

AY: Right. She had a big smile on her face when they performed _Beyond the Bottom_. I also think the girls were absolutely radiant on that stage with their cute white outfits and you could clearly see how happy and accomplished she was feeling!

**\-- I could say the same for you girls being as radiant when you sing** **_Beyond the Bottom_** **on stage.**

AY: Well… Of course we are! The song takes most of the credit, though! It pulls on your emotions so well and it’s the work of a genius composer, Tanaka Hidekazu. It feels so different yet it’s so us! We’re blessed with so many good songs and _Beyond the Bottom_ is my favorite of them all.

**\-- Does it represent WUG as it is now in the same way** **_Tachiagare!_** **did when you were starting out?**

AY: I guess so. I get so embarrassed whenever I listen to the CD version of _Tachiagare!_. We sound so bad! Especially my final line, though it’s still making me tear up. (laughs) Back then, we didn’t even know how to properly handle the mic, so I kind of feel like we know a little better now.

**\-- How about the live version of** **_Beyond the Bottom_****?**

AY: It’s so awesome! I always feel like crying at every line even though the choreography is very frantic. The song that makes me cry the most though is _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_. My favorite line is “_ippai nayanda hibi wa kesshite muda janai kara_” \[Roughly, "Our everyday worries aren't in vain."\]. It reminds me of the days when we worried about Director Yamamoto scolding us… oh, there goes the tears again. (laughs)

![](/images/sp-1604122300-10.jpg)

**\-- Sounds like he’s especially fond of scolding and teasing you.**

AY: He does! It always sounds like he’s being sarcastic even though he puts in a good word for us, like during _Beyond the Bottom_’s initial screening.

**\-- Maybe he’s just not being honest with his feelings.**

AY: Yeah. I do know he appreciates who I am.

**\-- I can imagine him being all grumpy when you’re all together but secretly being your biggest fan.**

AY: Well, I don’t know if I’d feel glad about that though… (laughs)

**\-- (laughs) I want to ask next about last year’s closing event,** **_Wake Up, Girls! Festa 2015 Beyond the Bottom Extend_****.**

AY: That was my first time seeing a monitor at the very back of the hall. When we were singing _Tachiagare_ for the encore, it showed videos of the previous year’s Festa. Seeing Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu) as she was then compared to who she is now was so inspiring. She’s so good, it made me cry. It even showed videos from our first Anisama (Animelo Summer Live), which also made me cry, though I have to say I don’t recall looking that close to tears during the actual performance.

**\-- It wasn’t like your first tour in Osaka.**

AY: I’d rather forget about anything related to that! However, the _Tachiagare_ of that stop is my all-time favorite, and my second would be… I’m not sure yet but the one we did at Festa last year might be it since it felt like it was calling out to of our past, present, and future.  

![](/images/sp-1604122300-12.jpg)

**\-- Speaking of which, I do think that it’s a nice setup for you. Your condition in Osaka may not be ideal \[Referring to her struggling to catch her breath by the end, especially the encore\] but seeing you overcome that in later shows gives it a much bigger impact.**

AY: That’s a good way of putting it. Hopefully, we get to pull off something grand someday so watch out for it. (laughs)

**\-- Moving on, I finally get to ask you this question. What were your dreams and aspirations when you auditioned for WUG and have you achieved them?**

AY: I wanted to become a voice actress. I mentioned in previous interviews that I auditioned for the role of Elly for _Milky Holmes_, participated in the _1st Avex Anisong Vocal Audition_ for i☆Ris, and tried out different ways that could put me on the path of becoming a voice actress. So when I auditioned for WUG, it was more with that mindset than the idea of becoming part of WUG.

**\-- Speaking of** **_Milky Holmes_****, you posted a picture of you and Ito Ayasa-san (voicing Myojingawa Alice) on your blog last year.**

AY: Oh yeah, we became friends! I went to watch a stage play that starred Zucchan (Shibuya Azuki) and Himitasu (Akaneya Himika) \[from i☆Ris\] and they brought me over to the break room because Ayaka-san wanted to become friends with me. When she saw me, she went “It’s really you!”, and I wanted to say the same. (laughs) I was planning to audition for her role if I failed the WUG audition so meeting her, who also took the Elly audition, feels fateful, in a way.

**\-- I think it's nerve-racking that auditions like that practically boils down to the applicant's physical condition on that given day.**

AY: I was surprised to see comments for that blog post saying I could have also been a good Elly. It's an open audition and a life-changing one, so it's no surprise that a lot of people applied.

![](/images/sp-1604122300-09.jpg)

**\-- By the way, knowing how the voice acting industry can be frantic and fast-paced, what kind of voice actress do you want to become? Is there someone you look up to?**

AY: I admire Hayami Saori. I love _Sekirei_ and she got the lead role while was in second year high school. I was in sixth grade at the time, thinking how cool that was, if I could somehow be like her. I mean, she was so young and still in school at the time, yet she was already a great actress!

**\-- How do you measure yourself to her now, especially that you're a bit older than she was back then?**

AY: I was also in my second year of high school when I debuted with _Wake Up, Girls!_, so I kind of felt like I got on her level. (laughs) I hope that someday I could work with her but I know I have much to improve. She's such a good singer as well. She even got to sing the opening theme...

\[She wrote in her blog that she finally got to meet Hayami Saori during one of the events promoting _Kakegurui_ in 2018 because she was there to perform the opening theme as part of D-Selections. She fangirled and got to take a picture with her.\]

**\-- This might be purely coincidental but wasn't** **_Sekirei_****'s opening theme done by the** **_Tachiagare!_****'s composer?**

AY: Yeah. They're both done by Kousaki Satoru! It kind of feels like fate since I used to sing _Sekirei_ in karaoke all the time.

**\-- Speaking of fate, (At the time of interview) you're about to do joint live show with i☆Ris \[Valentine live\], the group you previously auditioned for.**

AY: I can't recall anymore what happened there but I remember feeling so dejected when the 6 members were announced. Then I watched them perform and I was floored by how good they are. We were still taking lessons for WUG at the time and I used to go home tired and found myself watching videos of their performances as a way to recharge. They're amazing and you could see how much they love their group. They work hard, trust each other, and never give up as they aim higher. That's not something you see nowadays since all you normally see is drama, and we're thinking how we could become a group worth recognizing by them!

\[Eventually, Yoppi and Zucchan became more or less best friends and often hung out according to Yoppi's accounts in her blog during 2014-2015.\]

![](/images/sp-1604122300-13.jpg)

**\-- And finally you get to perform with them on the same stage.**

AY: It's so cool, isn't it? Being on stage, I get to be on the same level as them instead of just being a fan. It's more than just getting to watch them as part of the audience or from a DVD!

**\-- What do you feel about WUG covering** **_Make it!_** **and i☆Ris covering** **_Tachiagare_****?**

AY: I'm so excited that it's hard to put into words! I can't even imagine how they'll do _Tachiagare_, so I can't wait to see it. We actually exchanged choreographers for this. They had SATOMI teach them _Tachiagare_, while we had MIKA for _Make it!_. Our first lesson with her definitely brought us out of our comfort zone.

**\-- Though you also got to show what you can do, I imagine.**

AY: All I remember was crying during her lessons. (laughs) It took us about two hours to master _Make it!_ so I guess we did make some progress. I'm so familiar with _Make it!._ I've seen it countless times, so I'm just glad we didn't perform _Realize!_ because that is much harder. (laughs)

**\-- Moving on, what do you think about Shiraki-san's (I-1 Club's general producer) cryptic announcement during Festa 2015 that they'll assimilate WUG into I-1 Club?**

AY: What's that even about?! I don't get it! I'm guessing that means it’s not the end yet for the girls... maybe? (laughs) Regardless, I want everyone to forward to it, and hopefully, Yoshino-chan's hair would have gotten longer by then.

**\-- I'll be looking forward to it! Finally, any parting words and messages that you want to share?**

AY: The sequel movies did a lot to advance the story but it seems like it's not over yet. There's much more in store for the girls and that goes the same for us so we'll work just as hard! As for me, I aim to challenge myself with more opportunities to gain experience as I polish my skills as a voice actress. I hope you keep supporting me!
