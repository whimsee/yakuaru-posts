**\-- I would like to ask what pushed you to audition for Wake Up, Girls!, since your activities as part of the unit began when you were still in high school.**  
  
Yoshioka Mayu (YM): I've had prior acting experience but I always wanted to be a voice actress and sing anime songs. I was hesitant at first but when I approached my mom about it, she told me "It's your life, do what makes you happy." (laughs) She almost sounded indifferent but she's always been there to support me so hearing that gave me the push I needed to take the step.  
  
**\-- How did your life change once you became a member?**

YM: It happened right from the start. We were taught how to sing and dance, of course, but we also memorized formations, recorded voices as part of our voice acting work, took interviews, did photoshoots, and I even wrote scripts.  
These new opportunities opened up for me thanks to WUG.

**\-- Since you're part of a 7-member unit, how would you describe your relationship with the other members?**  

YM: They are my friends as well as family. While we all have wildly different personalities and goals, once we're together we suddenly become a well-oiled machine. We had a lot of turning points as a group but one that sticks out to me was when the anime wrapped up and we were told we could still continue our activities as a voice acting unit. We put our heads together and tried to figure out what we could do.  
  
We wanted to do a pilgrimage tour around all six of Tohoku's prefectures since the anime was centered around Sendai and we aimed to someday do a show in Nippon Budoukan or Saitama Super Arena. Now that I think about it, perhaps that was when we earnestly began seeing each other as a unit.  

**\-- And now your group was able to accomplish one of those goals because your Final Live will be at the Saitama Super Arena.**  

YM: It really is like a dream come true and it's thanks to all the fans and management staff who have been supporting us that our dreams had slowly been realized. The final live will serve as a capstone to our final tour that spanned almost half a year and as the end of our activities draw closer, I feel more motivated to make the best out of this final show. That said, we will bring with us the experience we gained over the past six years as we move forward in our solo activities.

**\-- Have you always enjoyed doing live shows?**  

YM: I wasn't good at singing and dancing when we started but I realized through our activities that live shows are venues where we can interact with our fans and everyone gets together and form a world all to themselves. For instance, one gets to hear melodies different from the CD version and even a small difference in the audience of a given show changes how the responses will be. A live show is a place where a smile from one person spreads to others until each and every one of them brings to life a whole new vibe, and that shared atmosphere can really pull one in and encourage them to respond even more.  

That said... this might sound rude but back then I was so nervous I told myself to imagine the audience as a bunch of vegetables. (laughs) Somehow when I did that, I became less self-conscious, made less mistakes, and performed a little better. I did a lot of things like that.

**\-- Did anything in particular change that?**  

YM: This was during the first year or so when I sang my character Shimada Mayu's character songs. It left a deep impression on me and her personality slowly rubbed off until I became more confident on stage as myself and as a member of WUG. But it's only quite recently did I feel I could stand on my own. It could be because of all experience I gained over the years but I do know experience played a huge part.

\[In interviews and blog posts, her relationship with Shimada Mayu in regard to herself has been a point she occasionally brings up. At first, she wanted to be more like Shimada Mayu, often trying to emulate parts of her personality, even her hobbies or preferences because she respects her positive energy (which Director Yamamoto later commented during _Shadow of Youth_'s production was somewhat affected by Mayu's melancholic nature as time went on). Later on, she would then say that it's time for her to stand as her own as she accepted herself as someone fundamentally different from Shimada Mayu, if not the opposite and she is still someone she deeply respects as an irreplaceable part of herself.\]

**\-- I want to keep this positive vibes of this interview going but I do want to ask if you've gone through rough moments back then.**

YM: I was very unapproachable when the unit just formed and I still regret that a lot. The members told me that I was terribly unsociable back then. (laughs)

\[In blog posts, she mentions that the first person she got along with when the unit formed was Nanami since they roughly share the same dialect. It's also well known that she often had arguments with Yoppi at the start which became an inspiration for WUG Season 1 Episode 8.\]

**\-- What kind of attitude did you have?**  

YM: Since I was appointed as the center, I felt a lot of pressure to stand out, be the best, most hard-working, most capable member of the group and whenever the other members get praise during practice I start feeling it all the more.  

But that attitude changed as I slowly received more compliments, got more opportunities to perform in front of the audience and realize that there are fans coming to watch our shows. Just knowing that people are out there appreciating what we were doing gave me confidence.

**\-- I think it's great that you place a lot of importance on the audience and your fans.**

YM: I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them and the staff who have always been there to support me. It's because of them that I push myself to improve. That's why I made it a point never to turn down any work offers as long as it fits my schedule. Those jobs might not be for me or I might not necessarily enjoy them but I should always give them a shot. You never know the doors it might open but they chose me for it so I intend to give my 100%.

**\-- I want to ask about your voice acting work. What part of the job excites you the most?**  
YM: It's when I see a character on screen speak with my voice. I've done a lot of voice work for anime adaptations so I always feel glad when a fan of the original work appreciates what I do.

**\-- Was there a time when you were starting out that you struggled?**  
YM: I could just say all the time. (laughs) I debuted as a voice actress not long after passing the audition and I was always reprimanded by the staff. I felt so incapable of doing anything that I started questioning my abilities and hating myself. (laughs) But there wasn't any time to dwell on it so I focused at lot to at least be recognized as a decent voice actress.

Aside from learning the fundamentals of articulation and voice projection, I also learned how to empathize with the character I'm portraying, though I was often advised not to make conversations sound forced.

**\-- Forced in what way?**

YM: You don't just go up to someone in everyday conversation and say "Alright, let's talk!" But sometimes I get carried away and get too into it. Being able to read and carry the mood of the moment and communicate properly is something I had difficulty getting right and it's still something I watch out for even now.

**\-- I'm wondering if I should ask about side jobs if you have done any since you started your career while in high school.**

YM: I have since I moved to Tokyo to study and started living on my own! There were a lot of students in my university who juggled study with work so I eventually got influenced by them. But I only get as far the 3-month training period since work usually starts picking up by then. (laughs)

**\-- What kind of desk work have you done? Can you give a specific example?**

YM: This is a bit of an odd place to work in but it was at a fitness gym and I was being trained to do more than just desk work. I also had to memorize what's on the manuals and how the card system works, which were things I wasn't good at. (laughs) But I think it was a good to be exposed in that kind of environment. Actually, during one of those training periods, I even became a building announcer and even with a job as small as that, a lot of people complimented my voice. (laughs)

**\-- The experience of working for the sake of others is quite invaluable. How do you mentally prepare yourself when you go and try new things, including when you had those side jobs or when you accept career work?**

YM: Things always start rocky for me because I get carried away with emotions like excitement from taking on a challenge or even gratitude for being given a responsibility. But as long as I take it one step at a time, I know that a world of new possibilities will open up.
