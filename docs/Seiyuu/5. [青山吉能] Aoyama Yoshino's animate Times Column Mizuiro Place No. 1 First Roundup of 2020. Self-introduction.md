Aoyama Yoshino has started a bi-weekly column, _Mizuiro Place_, for animateTimes. For those familiar with her and her writing, it’s akin to having a torrent of emotions poured haphazardly on a page as text. So consider this one of many ways to interpret and translate it.

Feel free to contact me ([@jbtenmatay](https://twitter.com/jbtenmatay)) for any corrections, clarifications, and edits. Additions are in \[square brackets\].

How’s everyone doing? I’m doing well.

This is Aoyama Yoshino from 81 Produce, and animateTimes, my good friends ever since I hatched into this world, has graciously given me this place to write to you all!

I’m really glad, especially that this chance came when I thought I already had the perfect place for it \[referring to instagram because text limits\]. To think I’d become a columnist...∞...卍...

Since this is the first of many entries, allow me to introduce myself.

My name is 青山吉能! It’s read as “Aoyama Yoshino” but it’s not the easiest name to read so kindly call me “Yoppi.”

I’m from Kumamoto prefecture. My favorite foods are alcohol and anything that goes well with it (which is actually _Tarako_ Spaghetti). My skills are calligraphy and skiing, and throughout my school years, I was part of the choir.

I’m a headstrong _otaku_ from the boonies who wanted to be a voice actress so I entered audition after audition, failing all of them until the one for _Wake Up, Girls!_. Now I’m here and how fast time flies. And never has a day gone by in which I’ve lazed about in my futon, pondering about the myriad of things I could do, and end up doing none.

**Common Points Between You and Me**

* * *

By the way, did you know that I’m gifted?

I always, _always_, keep a close eye on my behavior—call it being critical of myself. I can’t help acting the fool but I’m actually radiate confidence. ha ha ha. It doesn’t take much to discourage me when things don’t go my way, though, so I make it a point not to expect too much. 

If I may be so bold, I absolutely adore my fashion sense and I enjoy looking at myself like you would a mannequin in a shop display, especially at my lovely white skin. I work out all the time and I clean up real well. I also love acting. I’d like to believe I’m someone people hope to be.

I’m also not like that some days. (_which is it, really_)  
It’s surprising how bad I look in selfies with friends.  
I’ve never forgotten how, in middle school, the boys in class would tease that my eyes look like clams. When I get bullied, I just laugh away; it hurts but I just bear it.  
It’s so, so, really, super hard to be me.

They say I’m fickle because I wear my emotions on my sleeve but really, is everyone happy or sad all the time? Riding a few waves is a lot more fun! I’m sure surfers would tell you the same.

Another one! I’d like to be happy when others are happy! 

That’s who I am as a human being… Right, I guess being human is the first thing we have in common… and I hope from here onward, we get to learn more about what our common points, one thing at a time.

**This Is Who I Normally Am**

…Which is why I started this column, _Mizuiro Place_.

_Mizuiro_ is the color light blue, my color… though I’m not so sure it describes me well… but it’s MY color. Hehehe, it could change into something else but to what? Who knows! 

You know… It’s been ages since I started by asking how everyone’s doing, right?  
Reminds you of me from the old days, doesn’t it?  
I was hoping I’d go back to doing it in the same style from when I was writing once-a-week for the Wake Up, Girls! blog but I got so overcome by emotion, I just couldn’t.

Things are going to be a little different here but in a good way.  
So feel free to interact with the Yoppi that you know and love.

Also, I’m voicing a monk named Makoto in this anime season’s _Shachibato! President, It's Time for Battle!_. Don’t miss it. (^^) ← first time I’m using this kaomoji like this!

I should really wrap this up so I’ll end here.

Until then.
