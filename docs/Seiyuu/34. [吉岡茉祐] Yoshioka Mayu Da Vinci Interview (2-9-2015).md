**\-- Alright. Let's begin!**  

Yoshioka Mayu (YM): Ahhh... the nerves. (laughs) I tend to go on and on once I start talking about myself. (laughs)  

**\-- Please do. (laughs) As the voice of the protagonist in the anime _Wake Up, Girls!_****, and the center of the voice acting unit of the same name, can you tell us what went through your mind when a sequel movie was being announced in Wake up, Girls! Festa 2014. That was quite the reaction!**  

YM: I was very happy because I was also hoping for news regarding a sequel. It was also the first time I saw the teaser and what really shocked me was Yoppi's \[Aoyama Yoshino\] new hairstyle. I was like, "Who's that?". (laughs) That aside, I'm glad that the girls' stories will continue and I'm sure it's something that our fans will like. They won't regret it!

**\-- What are you looking forward to seeing in the sequel \[Not yet announced as _Seishun no Kage (Shadow of Youth)_****\]?**  

YM: My hope is that it will feature stories that weren't explored in _7 Idols_ (_Shichinin no Idol)_ and the anime series. Personally, I'm interested in Matsuda-san's past because he mentioned in the prequel movie that he quit music long ago. And I think fans would like to know more about Hisami Nanami as well since she didn't get much development in the anime.

**\-- That's true. I wonder how Director Yamamoto and the rest of the staff thinks the story will unfold...**  

YM: Likewise. (laughs) It seems he has grand ideas for the plot since he always has something in mind whenever we talk about it. (laughs) Oh yeah, we don't have the details ironed out yet, but a new song \[_Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_\] will come with the movie.  

**\-- I'm looking forward to it! Is there anything that you want to improve upon for the movie?**  

YM: Out of the girls, I think my character, Shimada Mayu, is involved in most of the emotional scenes. (laughs) My deliveries always sounded flat, though. I’m more experienced now so I want my acting to be good enough to move people! This time I want to make it so convincing, it’ll make it a scene worth crying to. However, I also think Mayu-chan's would have gotten stronger emotionally since then so she might have fewer chances to do that.  

\[She mentioned in another interview that she had the most trouble in Ep 9 (The scene with Mayu and Kaya). She couldn't make a convincing emotional performance, which eventually made her cry in frustration in the booth after attempting it numerous times and being told that it wasn't good enough.\]

**\-- Can you tell us about Mayu-chan in** **_WUG ZOO_****? She seems a little different from the regular series.**  

YM:  She gets to show her ferocious side in _WUG ZOO_!. (laughs) I think she's the one who changed the most out of the girls since each had certain characteristics emphasized and became more expressive as a result. Mayu-chan's gotten more aggressive, for example, while Minami-chan pretty much only says "Unmenya~". (laughs) I think the one who changed the least was Kaya.  

![](/images/yoshioka_002.jpg)

**\-- On that note, it's been two years since the audition. What do you think has changed in you since then especially that you started working?**  

YM: I want to say everything about me has changed but I think what changed the most is my personality. I've had more chances to reflect and learn about myself. It's something I rarely did before, so the way I perceive myself has changed as a result. My experiences forced me to take a good look at myself and deliberate on what I needed to change, good and bad, and I discovered a new “me” along the way.  

\[Long comment: What made Director Yamamoto notice Mayu during the audition was her stubborn attitude and her vague reason to apply—She wanted to discover herself. She would remark at various blog posts how much she changed since WUG, including her approach to her work as a seiyuu and a performer (and the way she blogs).  
  
At first, she wasn't too keen on the idea of performing on stage due to her stage anxiety but come to love it so much that a lot of WUG's event ideas, for the most part, came from her and Airi's initiative, which eventually inspired the rest to do the same. This includes her call-and-response routines (They wrote that she got carried away and accidentally started it during 7GW in 2014), pre-event narration skits that she wrote starting 1st Live Tour (initially with the script supervisor’s blessing and eventually continued because she just wanted to keep doing it), 4th Tour's setlist that she requested staff they should do (She and Airi mostly decided on the setlist when they got the unexpected OK), Polaris' lyrics that she wrote and arranged with the help of the other members, and final live's reading dramas, etc.  
  
This also extends to her perception of Shimada Mayu, who she sees is a more girly persona who wants to become a cute idol but also an irreplaceable part of her life. Over time, she would slowly shift from playing her character, Shimada Mayu, to someone more ideal to her, someone cool and intense like LiSA\]

**\-- From your perspective as the group's center, have you noticed improvements from the other members?**  

YM: I have. Objectively speaking, Yoppi's dancing improved by a lot... and I guess I can say the same for her personality. (laughs) A few of us didn't have any dance experience. They couldn't even manage two-step moves but now they can do complex dance sequences like it was nothing. Minami couldn't even do sit-ups before, and Kaya's the shortest but she figured out how to exaggerate and make herself stand out on stage. They've really gone a long way and that's awesome.  

Also, they're all so fashionable now! I can’t say that about me and my poor fashion sense. I’m still in the process of getting used to trends here in Tokyo. (laughs)

\[During 2013-2014's blog posts, the members often talked about her. If it wasn't some idea she thought up, it's her being too good that they wanted to catch up to her as a rival, except for fashion. She would ask everyone, usually Airi, to rate her clothing choices.\]  

**\-- Did Director Yamamoto ever acknowledge how much you’ve improved?**  

YM: Not individually but he usually goes to our shows and gathers us afterward to give a general comment. One time last year, after our final show for the tour, he gave us a rare positive comment, which was a bit of a shock. (laughs)  

**\-- Have you ever felt the pressure of being the center?**  

![](/images/yoshioka_003.jpg)

YM: I get asked that often and I don’t really feel it. Thankfully, we all have our moments to become the center. (laughs) Whether it's due to the formation or the solo parts, everyone gets their time in the spotlight. However, I have to embody my role as the center during MC. (laughs) I just realized this lately, but we all need to speak up and not let a single member take all the attention. Though when it counts the most, a certain member is always there to read the mood and take over.  

**\-- Who?**  

YM: Minami! She always has a good grasp of the situation and knows when to be goofy or serious. I can always rely on her whenever I’m in a pinch. She’s a good singer and a hard worker, and the most mature out of all of us!  

\[Conversely, Minami and her sister are fans of Mayu. Minami would always try to go to Mayu’s live and theater shows and fangirl about it in the blog, and her sister collects Mayu merch, including the gravure and photobook, and tries goes to her signing events and solo live shows, and then reports to Minami who relays it in her blog and radio shows.  
  
Minami was initially considered to become the center, and during 3rd live's MC section, Mayu said that if anything were to happen to her for whatever reason, there was no one else in the group she would entrust the position to other than Minami.\]  

**\-- Moving on, can you tell us about** [**_Chanoputeki Drama series (ちゃんおぷ的ドラマ) Part 2_**](http://object-co.jp/goods/chanopu2.html) **and your role, Mayuka?**  

YM: I get to work with Nanami for this project and I play the role of a college student. There was actually a lot of ad-libbing and you could say that a lot of it came from personal experience. (laughs)  

![](/images/yoshioka_005.jpg)

**\-- I guess the title, _Bakuretsu Joshi Kaigi!! (爆裂女子会議!!)_ gives it away somewhat. (laughs) Given that you perform with 4 other cast members, being able to ad-lib like that must have been difficult...**  

YM: Well, midway through, it was like we were all working off each other’s ad-libs! Nanami and I were in the same group and we had wordplay competitions, relays and rapping contests. The others were already veterans who performed in the previous series so they already knew what to do!  

**\-- You’re also voicing the role of Tenia in GREE’s** **_Rebellion Blade_****.**  

YM: She’s a mechanic and she’s such a cool character. I always wanted to voice a character like her, so getting this role feels like an achievement. (laughs)  

**\-- Not only that, you get to speak in the Kansai dialect.**  

YM: That too! The other members always tease me that I'm a fake. I can't wait to get up on their face and say, "Hah! I told ya so! I finally get to voice a character in Kansai dialect!" (laughs)  

\[Mayu labels herself as someone who was raised in both Tokyo and (North) Osaka because she has close family in both regions and often travels between them for one reason or another (most likely family gatherings and her association with Himawari and Blue Shuttle Theater Group pre-WUG), though her father, who she calls "papa" since she was little, jokingly scolds her for misremembering how to refer to McDonald's in Kansai whenever she comes home for the tour, and she often jokes that people are always surprised to learn that she is from Kansai.\]  

**\-- Now for some personal questions! Can you rank your three favorite things!**  

YM: I love theater, first and foremost. I was part of _You Be Cool!_ last year and I feel that my circle of theater acquaintances is growing. Actually, can I show you my notebook? It’s full of notes about the shows I watched, their cast members, and my impressions. Last December, I watched about one show a week. Some were performed by Kochira Super Usagi Teikoku (_こちらスーパーうさぎ帝国_), who we worked with for _You Be Cool!_, Otomestage’s _Gijin Kareshi (擬人カレシ)_, and a few others. Hah… I can talk for days once you get me started on theater. (laughs)

**\-- The amount of notes you put in there is pretty impressive!**  

![](/images/yoshioka_004.jpg)

YM: Actually, this notebook came from one of our WUG fan events. It’s ring bound with a golden leaf design that we decided with the fans. At first, I used it to write down notes during lessons but it ended up becoming my theater notebook. (laughs)  

**\-- Do you usually keep a continuous diary?**  

YM: This is my first doing this! I think there's value in keeping a record of the past to reminisce. This notebook is twice as heavy as my previous one so it’s seeing a lot of use. (laughs)

\[She stated in a video show that what got her into acting was Miyano Mamoru. She first knew of him as a stage actor and was later surprised to discover that he was also a voice actor who had many talents. This inspired her to do the same and become a multi-talented "Can do anything" voice actress.\]

**\-- What’s your second favorite thing?**  

YM: I’m a spontaneous dancer. The other members tell me that I often start dancing on my own whenever we wait for the train.  

\[They said the same thing in Anisama’s 2017 talk and live special. Mayu is a spontaneous dancer, Yoppi is a spontaneous singer.\]

**\-- You’re not aware of it?**  

YM: My body just moves on its own especially when I’m listening to music on my earphones. (laughs) I just lose myself into it and I end up improvising. (laughs) When you think about it, our character songs don’t come with choreography so we have to think of our own.  

**\-- How about your last favorite thing?**  

YM: I dunno. I like spicy food... Oh, I’ve gotten myself into preparing hot pots! It hasn’t been a year since I started living alone so last winter, I cooked maybe a hot pot every three days. (laughs) I usually go for kimchi but my favorite is the Pork and Cabbage Mille-Feuille Pot that I saw on TV! It only takes a few ingredients to prepare but it’s delicious and I can take my time eating it. I don’t normally cook for myself but it’s part of living alone. Once winter comes around, I’ll just grab whenever ingredients I find and make my own solo hot pot. (laughs)

**\-- How you aim to challenge yourself in the future!**  

YM: We saw an unforgettable sight when we performed in Anisama last year in the form of a sea of light sticks in a myriad of colors much like what the girls saw in the anime. Next time, I want all those colors to represent us! For that to happen, I have to mature and get better, both as myself and a voice actress, and show everyone how much we've improved through our experiences in the upcoming sequel movie.  

Also, through my writing hobby, I was given the opportunity to write shadow narrations for our shows. Someday, I want to get better at it so I can write my own theater script. Ever since I started performing in theater, I’ve always wanted to produce one. Hopefully, I get to expand my horizons as a voice actress that way and who knows, maybe I’ll even show up on TV!  

\[Mayu often talks about her writing hobby and the various short stories and novellas she has written in her free time. She hopes to someday share it, but so far she’s been able to showcase that in WUG’s narrative skits and segments, and lyrics for _Tegami_, _GLORIA_, _Sweet Sweet Place,_ and _Polaris_.\]    

**\-- Finally, a message to our readers!**  

YM: I’m sure a lot of people know about me through my role as Shimada Mayu in _Wake Up, Girls!_, but I’ll be appearing in more projects as I try to get my name out there. This is only the beginning and I hope to earn your support!
