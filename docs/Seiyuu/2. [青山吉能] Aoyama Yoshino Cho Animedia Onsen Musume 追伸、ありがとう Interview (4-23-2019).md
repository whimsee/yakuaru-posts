_Onsen Musume_ is a project to promote regions all across Japan that feature hot spring resorts (onsen) using voice actresses who portray characters modeled after their respective hot spring resorts. Through idol activities and events, the project aims to give smiles and joy to everyone, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima.

It has been two years since the project was launched and as a show of gratitude to everyone who has supported it since then, a song had been made. The title is _Tsuishin, arigatou_ (追伸、ありがとう) \[literally, "P.S. Thank you"\] and it is themed as a "letter" in the form of a song addressed to all the _poka-danna_ and _poka-okami_ (_Onsen Musume_ term to refer its supporters) for their involvement in the project.

_Tsuishin, arigatou_ releases on April 26, 2019. It is performed by onsen musume from regions that had been previously hit by earthquake disasters—[Iizaka Mahiro](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/iizaka_mahiro) from Fukushima Prefecture by Yoshioka Mayu,  [Aso Homura](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/aso_homura) by Takahashi Mari and [Hitoyoshi Aoi](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/hitoyoshi_aoi) by Aoyama Yoshino, both from Kumamoto Prefecture who had suffered two separate earthquake disasters. With their voices, they give their support to every region.

Cho! Animedia presents this interview with Aoyama Yoshino to commemorate its release. We ask her thoughts about her onsen musume, how her traits relate to her home prefecture of Kumamoto, and the person she wants to say thank you to.

Aoyama Yoshino as Hitoyoshi Aoi

**\-- Can you give a brief introduction about your character,** [**Hitoyoshi Aoi (人吉青井)**](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/hitoyoshi_aoi)

**Aoyama Yoshino (Aoyama):** Aoi-chan is the onsen musume of Kumamoto's Hitoyoshi Onsen (人吉温泉)! She loves castles, which are important cultural symbols in Kumamoto with places such as Hitoyoshi Castle and Kumamoto Castle. And since Hitoyoshi is famous for its shochu (a type of Japanese distilled liquor), she tends to act spoiled when she drinks it. I love that part of her since she’s the calm and collected type that really lets herself go if given the chance. As someone from Kumamoto, I’m happy to see a character whose preferences represent it’s unique qualities.

**\-- Are you also glad that you get to portray a character such as her?**

**Aoyama:** Of course! I've known about _Onsen Musume_ so when I learned there’s going to be a character representing Kumamoto, I wanted to be the one to portray her no matter what and I was pleasantly shocked when I got the role. I’ve gone to Hitoyoshi Onsen before and even stayed in lodgings around the area. And her given name, Aoi, comes from Aoi Aso Shrine (井阿蘇神社), which I’ve also visited. Being given the opportunity to portray a character modeled after places familiar to me… It’s a dream come true. I’m very happy.

**\-- I can really see the deep appreciation you have for your home. In that case, can you tell me something about Kumamoto that sets it apart from everywhere else?**

**Aoyama:** It would have to be the food and water. They both taste great! The tap water in Kumamoto City comes entirely from underground, which gives it a nice taste. I rarely bought bottled water when I used to live there and it was in Toyko where I saw water dispensers for the first time. My parents even forbade me from drinking water straight from the kitchen faucet once I had moved to Tokyo and, to be honest, I can really tell the difference.

**\-- People do say that good water makes for good food and alcohol.**

**Aoyama:** Exactly! It’s the same for rice and horses that are nourished by it. Moving to Tokyo really made it clear to me how great Kumamoto is.

**\-- Even the ramen is delicious.**

**Aoyama:** I can't get enough of it. I love adding garlic oil and fried garlic!

\[Yoppi's favorite ramen place is _Yashi no Ki_ in Kumamoto and the place also features her, complete with merchandise and her music streaming through the speakers if they happen to notice their customers as fans of her.\]

**\-- Is there something about portraying her that you feel particularly conscious of?**

**Aoyoma:** She speaks in the Kumamoto dialect. I’ve voiced characters with it before but not to this extent. (laughs) Since I speak it, I can also speak the dialects of regions south of Kumamoto to a convincing degree, which makes me all the more conscious not to sound fake. When we started recording, we redid lines every time the intonation felt off so she became a character that the staff and I hashed out together.

**\-- I can see why because she’s a character meant to promote the region.**

**Aoyama:** That’s right. There are also other onsen musume in Kumamoto such as [Aso Homura](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/aso_homura), [Kurokawa Kira](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/kurokawa_kira), and [Tamana Mami](https://onsen-musume.jp/character/tamana_mami) but only Aoi-chan speaks with a dialect so I want her to stand out with that. Especially against Kurokawa, I won’t let her show us up!

**\-- You’ve made yourself quite a rival there since Kurokawa Kira (CV: Tanaka Minami \[fellow Wake Up, Girls!\]) seems to be doing great as the center of the _Onsen Musume_ unit _Adhara_, not to mention they have a solo live on May 25.**

**Aoyama:** What’s an _Adhara_ anyway? (laughs) I’m joking. I’ll do my best to promote _Onsen Musume_ in any way I can!

**\-- You have my support! On that topic, you were selected as one of the singers for _Tsuishin, arigatou_****. Now that recording just wrapped up, can you tell me your candid thoughts about it?**

**Aoyama:** This song was difficult. When I listened to the demo, I honestly thought it was impossible for me to sing it. I love singing but it had a tempo and key signature that I couldn’t do perfectly. It was also the first time I get to sing as Hitoyoshi Aoi so I was feeling tense… I couldn’t do it at all when I first sang it in full that I got depressed.

**\-- It can't be that bad...**

**Aoyama:** I almost cried. I think I only got through it thanks to Aoi-chan. When I was singing in front of the music score, I focused my attention to her until I was finally able to sing it. Until then, I’ve been singing countless times as Aoyama Yoshino so I may have been disregarding what Aoi-chan was feeling. So I thought of her and imagined how she would sing it, how she would convey her feelings, and things went smoothly after that.

**\-- So you put who she is into consideration into your singing.**

**Aoyama:** I focused only on that, essentially.

**\-- What kind of direction did they give you?**

**Aoyama:** This might not answer your question but they gave me a lot of compliments as we were recording, and I’m the type that gets better with praise.

**\-- I-I can see that. (laughs)**

**Aoyama:** Our conversations would go like, “You’re doing great!” and I’d go “Really!?” and I started feeling more at ease. They really worried for me. (laughs)

**\-- I think it really was because you’re doing great.**

**Aoyama:** Thank you. (embarrassed)

**\-- Since _Onsen Musume_** **also has other songs in various styles, which do you want to sing?**

**Aoyama:** _Seishun Cider (青春サイダー)_ by one of the main units, _SPRiNGS_. That was the first _Onsen Musume_ song I knew and I remember thinking how bubbly the title sounded. I love how overflowingly cheerful it is since youth (seishun) and cider are both pleasant ideas.

**\-- It's easy to get into and there’s a depth to the lyrics that make it appealing!**

**Aoyama:** I absolutely adore it.

**\-- I can tell how much you feel that way. (laughs)**

**Aoyama:** I can barely contain myself. (laughs) _Onsen Musume_ songs are so varied, I imagine their live shows are a lot of fun. Hopefully, I get to be part of a unit someday or be able to assist their live shows in some capacity.

**\-- How about a unit composed of members from Kyushu?**

**Aoyama:** I would love that but I also want a group full of emotional members. I believe in the power of emotion above all else, and I live following my emotions so I also want that for _Onsen Musume_. They have some really nice outfits so I can already imagine what we’ll get. We mentioned Adhara a while ago but I saw _petit corolla_’s outfits during Summer Sonic Festival and they were so cute.

**\-- I’ll look forward to seeing you wear their exclusive outfits. Okay, since _Tsuishin, arigatou_** **sends a clear message of “thank you,” who do you want to say “thank you” to right now?**

**Aoyama:** This might be a common answer but I want to say that to my mom. Since 5th grade, I've always been a rebellious daughter, which makes it twelve years and counting at this point. (laughs) Whenever she comes by, we’d just argue about the silliest things. One time, we went out to buy a futon and she scolded me for making too much of a fuss about it and I fought back and turned it into a bigger issue.  
  
My mom is very persistent in the way mothers are so sometimes I want to get away from her and that time went our separate ways in the department store. I eventually regretted saying the things I said, called her to apologize and we ended up looking for a futon together again. That’s how it usually goes between us. (laughs)

**\-- So instead of just saying "Sorry" (gomen ne), you also want to tell her "Thank you" (arigatou).**

**Aoyama:** Yes. I think for the Japanese people, there’s a sense of gratitude embedded in the word “Sorry.” For instance, when you throw away things you don’t need anymore, there would be times where you say “sorry” that also means “thank you.” But in my case, I want to properly convey the meaning of those words as they are. That’s something I’m working on right now. All this time I’ve been saying “sorry” to my mom but this time I want to say “thank you.”

\[There's a lot of context to point out here regarding her relationship with Kumamoto and her mother that's better expressed by reading her Final Tour Kumamoto Letter. Translated C/O Instigare [http://oha.yoppi.moe/2019/01/05/yoshinos-tree/#Yoshinos\_Letter](http://oha.yoppi.moe/2019/01/05/yoshinos-tree/#Yoshinos_Letter)\]

**\-- Thank you for all the interesting responses. To close things off, can you give a few words to our readers?**

**Aoyama:** Onsens are places that are found all over Japan. With my involvement in _Onsen Musume_ as a voice actress, I hope to contribute to their efforts in any way I can and I’ll do my best to make sure their projects get more attention in the region. _Tsuishin, arigatou_ is a song full of emotion so I encourage everyone to give it a listen!
