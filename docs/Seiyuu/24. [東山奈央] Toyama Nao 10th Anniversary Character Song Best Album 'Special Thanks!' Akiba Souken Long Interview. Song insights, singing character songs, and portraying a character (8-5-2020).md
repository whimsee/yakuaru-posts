This interview was published to coincide with the release of Toyama Nao’s Character Song Best Album “Special Thanks!”, which also commemorates her 10th anniversary as a voice actress. The 2-disc album is a collection of 25 character songs taken from roughly 250 that she has sung throughout her career, 2 of which have been recorded specifically for this album. The anniversary special release includes a third disc that features 3 new song covers and a 20-minute audio drama.

To make them search friendly, song titles will be written in their original and romaji forms at first mention (except for katakana or when sensible). Youtube embeds are part of the original article unless indicated otherwise.

**_It’s been a decade yet I’m even more excited for what the future has in store._**

* * *

**\-- Let me begin by congratulating you for reaching your tenth year as a voice actress.**

**Toyama Nao (TN):** Thank you. Ten years feels like a long time but I’ve always kept surging ahead ever since I started so it just kind of snuck up on me. I don’t usually have that many opportunities to look back on things, but being involved in the creation of this character song album really got me to reminisce. So in that sense, just getting to work on it was a treat.

**\-- You started your career while you were in college, right?**

**TN:** I did. I started during my freshman year, which meant I spent a handful of years juggling responsibilities as a college student and a voice actress. I definitely got my work cut out for me, but I guess I’ve already gotten accustomed to it because I used to attend six to seven classes during middle school and high school.

**\-- Would it be accurate to describe you as someone who gets motivated in the face of a packed schedule?**

**TN:** That’s a good way of putting it. I love working. You could even say I’m a workaholic. (laughs)

**\-- Looking back on your voice acting career, you’ve had quite an eventful decade.** 

**TN:** There have been fits and starts, as you would expect, but being in an environment where I get to constantly focus on work is something I’m truly grateful for. Even now, I feel blessed every day I get to set off for work.

**\-- You must spend a lot of time in studios, then.**

**TN:** I tend to find myself holed up somewhere more often than not; not just for dubbing and music recordings but also radio and dance rehearsals. I guess I’m starting to sound like (Suzumiya) Haruhi. (laughs)

**\-- That also means you’re constantly in a creative atmosphere.**

**TN:** Voice actors primarily work behind-the-scenes where we only have our voice to express ourselves, but nowadays it seems that we get to do it in just about every way imaginable—we act, we sing, we dance, we talk. It’s like we get to employ all these forms of expression now as part of our job to entertain.

**\-- A voice actor’s work certainly covers a wide range.**

**TN:** Being in the presence of accomplished veterans in the voice acting industry alone is already awe-inspiring. But you also see a lot of voice actors in places where they need someone who can do anything that is asked of them. I picked up singing and dancing because I love doing it so I feel fortunate whenever I’m given opportunities to exhibit those skills. Of course I have to give it my all and improve as I go along, no matter what it is, which means I also have to face the ones that I’m not good at… doing radio shows being one of them.  

**\-- Wow, you really think so? But you sound so confident in them.**

**TN:** Oh no, if only. (laughs) Back when I started, I used to cry all the time on my way back home. I get so frustrated thinking that I subjected my listeners to thirty minutes of boredom.

**\-- And you’ve completely figured it out now?**

**TN:** I’m having a lot of fun with it now. I used to think talk shows are not for me; acting is my bread-and-butter so there was a time when I avoided doing them. But I realized I’ll never be good at them unless I tried my best and kept at it. And now ten years in, I’ve overcome those roadblocks, and I’m getting even more excited looking forward to what else the future has in store.

**Picking 25 character songs from roughly 250**

* * *

**\-- Since we’re also here to talk about the character song best album “Special Thanks!”, it must have been a daunting task picking from a pool of more than 200 songs.** 

**TN:** When I started my solo singing career in 2017, I’ve already done about 200 songs. Now it’s close to 250, I think. That meant paring down that count to a tenth of it. If this were an exam, I wouldn’t know where to start. (laughs)

**\-- At least you can say they’re your personal picks. What were your criteria in deciding them?**   

**TN:** It was tough. I wondered if we could just put all of them in but that wouldn’t be good for anyone who buys it. (laughs) So I figured it would be better to focus on my highlights of the past 10 years, picking songs that people are very familiar with, along with ones that are not as well-known but carry a place in my heart. That doesn’t mean the ones I didn’t pick have no significance to me but those 25 songs were what I settled with. 

**\-- Since you chose them, I think they’re worth including for a good reason. Since you mentioned picking songs that people might not have heard, which ones were you referring to?**

**TN:** Songs like _Nisemono Chuuihou_ (ニセモノ注意報). It’s a song from the album _Shuuen-Re:act-_ by Shuuen no Shiori Project. It’s a vocaloid song, so it doesn’t necessarily fit the mold of conventional singing, especially the last bit where the tempo really ramps up to over 300 beats per minute. 

**\-- That’s really fast.**

**TN:** Whenever we record songs, I would configure my headphone setup so I can follow the song in a way that’s preferable. Tempo is important to me, so I always make sure I can hear the click of the metronome. _tick tick tick,_ just like that.  
  
The tempo for this was so quick it was just _tictictictictictic_ that I had to have it turned off. (laughs) As I was entering the studio, part of me hoped that maybe they'll let me sing at a slower speed, which would then get sped up in post-production, since it’s a style that human beings don’t generally sing. That’s not what happened. This song is akin to trying something and coming out of it completely changed. (laughs)

**\-- Hearing you talk about makes me want to listen to it even more.**

**TN:** I imagine a lot of people don’t even know this song even exists because that was my only involvement in the project, and while it was included in the album, it was never used for an event. They’re in for a surprise once they listen to it.

**\-- I’m sure the people who enjoy your songs will like it. (laughs)**

**TN:** Another song people might not have heard of is _Ningen no uta_ (にんげんのうた) from _Maoyuu Maou Yuusha_. The series doesn’t actually have character songs per se but this was sung by my character, the maid’s younger sister. It never got into the show, so it can only be heard in the official soundtrack release, so I imagine most people don’t even know about it.

**\-- It’s safe to assume that only the ones who bought the soundtrack would have heard it.**

TN: Exactly. She’s a kid so I had to make sure she sings like she’s not actually singing, just strictly following a beat. The lyrics, however, have a serious tone since they shed light in the story and her personal background. That gave the song such a striking contrast that drove me to include it. 

**\-- I can tell you have so many things to say for every song.**

**TN:** I’d talk about the work it was associated with, my experience with the character, even how it was recorded, if I could. (laughs) The booklet has everything I have to say about the nitty-gritty details. I rarely get to talk about them so I’d be great if it gets people to give them a listen. Another thing to point out is that the songs aren’t arranged chronologically so that’s something to keep in mind as you go through it.

**\-- Which brings us to the lively starting song of the first disc, _Susume! Kongougata Yonshimai_ (進め！金剛型四姉妹) from _Kantai Collection -KanColle-_**.

**TN:** The album starts out strong with a song by Kongou, Hiei, Haruna, and Kirishima, characters that I voice. I picked this as the starter because it clearly establishes right from the jump that this album will be filled with songs sung by a variety of characters.

**\-- It drives home the point that many different voices were used to sing these songs.**

**TN:** That’s right. And the song itself is just fun and impressive in its own right; I remember being so surprised when I got the offer. I’ve sung as two characters in a song until then, but this time I have to do four all by myself. (laughs)

**\-- Did you sing** **_all_** **four of them in one go?**

**TN:** I still need to breathe so doing it that way would be impossible so we recorded each character separately then it was put together as one piece. That said, there was a ballad sung by the Four Kongou-Class Sisters that I did sing in one go, _Teitoku (Anata) to no Kizuna_ (提督（あなた）との絆). That’s the song I sang a lot during the _Kankanshiki_ events.

**_Nakagawa Kanon, my starting point and a legendary presence in my life._**

* * *

**\-- The illustration of the anniversary special edition jacket was done by the artist of The World God Only Knows, Wakaki Tamiki. What can you tell me about the two character songs by Nakagawa Kanon,** **_Love call_** **(らぶこーる) and** **_Happy Crescent_** **(ハッピークレセント)?**

**TN:** Kanon is where everything started. She turned into such a significant character for me because I was able to embody her outside the anime during album release events and concerts. Everyone in the staff poured so much love into building her as a character in the four years that she was active.   
  
I hold her in such high regard, a legendary figure for me in fact, that I can’t just leisurely sing her songs in private or listen to them on CD. That’s why I really mustered my courage to sing her songs for my first solo concert in Nippon Budoukan, as it is one of the places sacred to her.

**\--  That must have been a difficult conflict to reconcile back then since you sang two of her songs during the encore.**

**TN:** I was hesitant about including her songs for this album. However, when I looked back at all the character songs I’ve done, I decided to go ahead with it because excluding them wouldn't give them the respect they deserve—rather it would feel like I was trying to forget them.

**\-- I can tell how important she is to you.**

**TN:** I know it’s well-understood that tropes exist for every character in any piece of work but Kanon is where my career started. I portrayed her as myself, Toyama Nao, for a long time with the help of so many people and she’s a very special part of my life.

**\-- The songs alone are quite impressive.**

**TN:** Thank you. I love how the melody is what you'll hear in traditional idol pop songs, catchy in the way that everyone likes. 

**\-- Moving on, I’d like to ask your thoughts about the closing song for _Croisée in a Foreign Labyrinth The Animation_****, _Koko Kara Hajimaru Monogatari_** **(ここからはじまる物語). You sang it as the protagonist, Yune, though personally I feel that it’s also a song that can be credited to you as a singer before your official debut. What can you say about it?**

**TN:** Although I debuted in the 2010 fall anime season for two shows—_The World God Only Knows_ and _Star Driver_—this was the anime where I, a nobody at the time, was cast for the leading role before both of them started being broadcast.

**\-- I see. The production turnaround for it must have been quick, since it came out during the summer of 2011.**

**TN:** In fact, we recorded _Koko Kara Hajimaru Monogatari_ in 2010. That’s also when I first got the offer of doing a release under my name, but I felt it would be too soon to debut as a solo artist at the time so we decided to release it instead as Yune’s character song. Because of that, the show left quite a deep impression on me.

**\-- It’s a great show. There's an exotic air to it, just as the name implies.**

**TN:** For a heartwarming story about personal encounters, the closing song is a fitting send off after an episode ends because of its optimistic message that “This is where it starts.” It’s with that same sentiment that I decided to make it the final song of the second disc.

**_I was cheered on by Rhodanthe\* before recording “Jumping!!”_** 

* * *

**\-- What can you say about _ReSTART "THE WORLD" (Logos Art Form in Dark)_, a song that you sang as Lieselotte Sherlock from Trinity Seven?**

**TN:** Ahh… That’s where I met TECHNOBOYS PULCRAFT GREEN-FUND. I became a big fan of them since then and they made _Living Dying Kissin’_ for my second album _Gunjou Infinity_. You wouldn’t expect _ReSTART "THE WORLD”_ to be a character song because it sounds very out of the norm but it fired me up to lean on it with my singing.

**\-- I noticed that the song was originally a closing duet between your character and Selina Sherlock, voiced by Suzaki Aya, and now a solo version is included in the album.**

**TN:** The duet and this solo version were recorded at the same time. What’s great about the duet is that we both sang them separately then TECHNOBOYS mashed them together as a whole.  
  
The solo version, on the other hand, has a more individual feel to it, turning it into a different song as a result; I remember being so impressed watching them work on it. I encourage everyone who encounters this song for the first time through this album to go back and listen to the original single release.

**\-- Getting to unravel those details is one of the fascinating aspects of this album.**  

**TN:** You said it. They’re great songs from wonderful shows so I’d be glad if it gets people to think of them again.

**\-- There’s only one song in the album that is solely credited to your name and that is** **_fragile_** **from** **_Tsuki ga Kirei_****. I’m curious as to why you chose it.**

**TN:** I had a lot of involvement in _Tsuki ga Kirei_ since I didn’t only sing the opening and closing song, but also an insert song, making it 6 pieces \[including instrumental versions\] in total. I wanted my connection to this series to have a place in the album so I decided to include it although it is a solo song under my name. And since the song itself speaks for the emotions felt by all of the characters, I think it is practically a character song in its own right.

**\-- Now let’s talk about the two character songs that were newly-recorded for this album as they’re both originally group songs that got their own character solo version. Let’s start with _Ichido dake no Koi nara ~Reina Solo~_ (一度だけの恋なら 〜Reina Solo〜) from Macross Delta. You can definitely hear Reina’s own take with it.**

**TN:** I was certainly going to include a song from _Macross Delta_, but since Reina doesn’t really have any songs where she’s the sole main vocalist, we decided to record a new solo version of a group song.  
  
In fact, I didn’t pick this song, the director did, and at first I wasn’t sure how to tackle it as Reina because the main vocals played on the contrast between JUNNA’s powerful voice as Mikumo and my whispery delivery as Reina. But it worked out surprisingly well and we managed to draw out the strong qualities of both her and the song. Mikumo and Reina possess their own unique brand of coolness and this rendition was able to perfectly capture that.

**\-- And the other song that got a new solo was _Jumping!!_****,  Rhodanthe\*’s closing song for _Kin-iro Mosaic_****, now sung by Kujou Karen.**

**TN:** It’s an awfully energetic song, so I wasn’t confident at all singing it on my own. (laughs) When this was originally recorded, it was all five of us simultaneously in separate booths with headphones on to follow each other along, which immediately evoked Rhodanthe\*’s fun vibe. When it was decided we’d do a solo recording, I actually received messages of support from the rest of the members through LINE that went like “You can do it, Nao-chan!” (laughs) 

\[Worth noting, this group setup is uncommon. Generally, group songs are recorded separately then combined in post-production. It’s done one member (or batch) at a time, with the first one usually becoming the “baseline” that everyone else follows and adjusts to. This allows for a lot of flexibility and consistency in mixing, creating different versions of the same song without having to re-record.\] 

**\-- That’s touching to hear and it sounds like a very Rhodanthe\* thing to do. (laughs)** 

**TN:** I also lined up drawings of their characters on the music stand so that they're with me even though I'm singing alone. I know that doing a job means you have to do your best work no matter what, but I believe that your mental state can affect you in ways that you can’t really explain so I made sure to be mentally prepared going into it. I knew in my mind that if I sing with my dearest thoughts to them, it will turn out well.

**_Singing new covers of my three favorite theme songs._**

* * *

**\-- We’ve been talking about the 2-disc regular edition of the album, which contains 25 songs, but now I’d like to know more about the anniversary special release’s third disc that contains three song covers.**

**TN:** Since reminiscing about the past is the underlying theme of this album, I prioritized songs from earlier works over newer ones. But of those recent ones, I wanted to do covers of my three favorite theme songs: _SHINY DAYS_ from _Laid-Back Camp_, _Harumodoki_ (春擬き) from the second season of OreGairu, and _Korekara_ (これから) from _Tamayura_.

**\-- They’re all popular theme songs from well-known series. They’re also newly arranged, which brings out a new side to them. Starting with** **_SHINY DAYS_****, how was your experience singing it?**

**TN:** We requested Yuru Camp’s sound director Tateyama Akiyuki to handle the arrangement. The original arrangement sung by Asaka had a pleasant and powerful western feel to it, so I wanted mine to have a cuter and more lighthearted tone. It turned into a rendition that is reminiscent of the background music in the anime, which makes it feel like you’re out there camping, using Northern European instrumentals that evoked the image of singing with nature present all around you.

\[Regarding arrangement, it differs from composition where the melody is created by the composer. Everything else—instrumentals, tempo, harmony, key, etc.—is handled by the arranger. The distinction is notable in crediting who did what since some songs may be composed and arranged by the same person and covers may be arranged by someone other than the original arranger.\]

**\-- It’s clear from the new arrangement how it communicates the joys of camping.**

TN: It got me in a camping mood the moment I heard the intro. (laughs) You could say the song is full to bursting with that excitement.

**\-- How about for _Harumodoki_****?** 

**TN:** _OreGairu_ is the anime series I’ve been involved with the longest, with the second season often thought of as the turning point in the story. Whereas season 1 has all the trappings of a romantic comedy, season 2 has a lot of heart-wrenching moments that manage to throw into chaos the relationships between the characters. That’s what makes it captivating and _Harumodoki_ being one of my favorite songs, I decided to pick it.

**\-- There are certainly layers upon layers of drama in _OreGairu_.**

**TN:** It takes a lot of focus to act with respect to Yuigahama Yui’s emotions. During season 2, there were many instances where I really had to push myself that it got me to dig deep and think of what acting truly meant for me.

**\-- Did that sentiment influence how you sang the song?**

**TN:** Since this isn’t a character song, I didn’t sing as Yui but instead projected some aspect of her into my singing. By doing that, I couldn’t just ignore her thoughts and feelings so those became part of the song.

**\-- The arrangement was also handled by the same person, Kitagawa Katsutoshi.**

**TN:** He created an entirely new arrangement. It was impressive because it can’t be a simple task to rearrange a song you’ve already done but it was a beautiful rendition in its own right. With the dubbing wrapped up and the conclusion of the series airing, this version has a mellower arrangement.

**\-- And the third song is** **_Korekara_****, which was written, composed, and sung by Sakamoto Maaya.**

**TN:** I voiced Tomo-chan in _Tamayura_, a series dear to me for putting me to tears with every episode. I wanted it to have a place in the album so I decided on doing a cover of _Korekara_. I was so nervous when I asked Sakamoto-san’s blessing, being the accomplished singer that she is, but she was all for it.

**\-- It’s a song beloved by everyone: from those who sing it, to the cast and staff, and the series’ fans.**

**TN:** Just hearing the intro makes me tear up so I was worried of it happening once we started recording. In the end, I did feel like crying the entire time.

**A 2-day concert of songs from the album**

* * *

**\-- There’s one more piece of content included in the third disk, an audio drama produced by Director Mizushima Seiji called** **_Yume no Kiseki_** **(夢の軌跡).**

**TN:** It features a colorful cast of characters, all voiced by me. People tend to think that switching roles is just a matter of changing your voice but I believe it’s not quite like that—what on the surface seems like just a change in voice is the actor internalizing certain emotions to bring a role into being.  
  
Being praised for having a recognizable voice for a role is one thing, but personally I wanted to communicate how important emotion plays into it, so I consulted Director Mizushima and the scriptwriter Asakusa Kaoru, which resulted with all the characters being close in age. That way, anyone who listens to it can better sense their differences in speech that are influenced solely by what they’re feeling. 

**\-- In a sense, it’s a work that demonstrates what it means to act out a role.**

**TN:** It’s not something that aims to impress because of how different the voices sound, rather how each voice fits the words they speak. That’s what the director and I wanted to make: a fresh approach to the question in the form of an audio drama.

**\-- It’s clear from hearing you talk about the album that it’s full of things worth listening to. And let’s not forget that it also comes in a gorgeous package, with the anniversary special edition featuring a 10th anniversary illustration, a booklet containing an interview, and a special box to keep them all together.**

**TN:** It’s an album I can make once in my life, and the staff put in a lot of effort in making it a box full of surprises.

![](/images/t640_868373.jpg)

**\-- That sounds exciting!**

**TN:** Indeed. Even though I already knew what’s in it, I was still surprised when I opened it. (laughs)

**\-- With the announcement of a series of 10th anniversary concerts “Special Thanks! フェスティバル” for December 5 and 6, why don’t we close things off by asking what to expect from it.**

**TN:** We're aiming to fill those days with select songs from the album. With the way things are right now, the last time I’ve performed on stage was February, making it my first concert in 10 months so I’m fired up.  
  
There’s still so many details to work out in meetings since the show’s main premise is bringing those characters to life and I’m the only one out of everyone involved who knows all of them. We’re hoping to make it a worthwhile show and I hope to see you all there.
