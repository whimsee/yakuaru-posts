**\-- In Green Leaves Fes (GLFes), the fans get pick songs for the setlist of both shows via survey. Can you tell us your thoughts about it?**

Yoshioka Mayu (YM): We first thought of having the fans decide on the setlist when we went to Shanghai last year \[BiliBili World\]. We wanted to try something new and, actually, I was surprised as well since didn’t expect we would do that for GLFes.

That said, GLFes is a new event so it felt like the right time to do something fresh. The Makuhari Messe Event Hall is a large venue and we get to perform with Run Girls, Run! (RGR), making it fitting as it will be an event full of new experiences.

We’ve just had our 5th anniversary live, which felt like a culmination of all our efforts up until that point, so this event feels like a beginning of a fresh start for Wake Up, Girls!.

**\-- I heard you’ve been active in organizing the group’s live shows lately. What were your impressions upon seeing the setlist?**

YM: Until now, we’ve considered how each song flows into the other, and how relevant it is to certain projects. This time, however, with the fans deciding the setlist, we could see laid out in front of us what our fans really felt, which was new to us. We learned which songs they really want to hear and which songs are popular.

We’re grateful because it gives us a wider perspective. The setlist features songs that we don’t usually include as part of a set so it’s something to look forward to.

**\-- If you could, which songs would you pick?**

YM: Actually, my mom just asked me the same question (laughs). I answered _Polaris_. Also, since we don’t get a lot of chances to sing I-1 songs, I’d choose _Knock Out_ as well. I want to dance to it!  

\[Knock Out did become part of the setlist but Mayu ended up not being one of the performers, to her dismay. She eventually got to perform it in Final live Part II\]

**\-- The audience really liked that song in your stage play \[Aoba no Kiroku\]. How about for Wake Up, Girls! songs?**

YM: _Beyond the Bottom_ and _Tachiagare_. Oh yeah, I want to sing _SHIFT_ was well.

**\-- That makes me excited for the next fan survey. I heard there was something else you’re planning to do.**

YM: Right. We circled the arena at [Animax Musix 2017 Yokohama](https://streamable.com/8k4wf).

**\-- You were performing _Geki! Teikoku-Kag_**_**ekidan**_**, right?**

YM: That was awesome. I thought about doing it as WUG someday, so I wondered if we could take the opportunity and do it here.

We always try to find ways to be as close as we can to the audience so we could sing and dance with them. The Makuhari Messe Event Hall is huge. You can see people from the very back waving their light sticks but you can barely see their faces. With a venue like that, we want to share the moment with those who came to see us.

**\-- You don’t many chances to get close to the audience during the tour, right?**

YM: Yes. In _Wake Up, Girls! Festa 2017 TRINITY_, even with the center stage and trolleys as a way to get close to our fans, we still can’t get to those at the very back.

**\-- That reminds me of what happened in the final episode of WUG _Shin Shou,_** **in that the girls wanted to be close to the audience. GLFes would be a good opportunity to do that.**

YM: I would like our fans not to give up on the idea of seeing us up close. We’re trying new ideas with our stage setup. Stands, walkways, and trolleys. It’s going to be fun.

\[Sure enough, Final Tour has been full of instances where the girls go to the audience area, even the ones on different floors.\]

**\-- This event will be the first time WUG and RGR will perform together. Airi and Nanami were with them in _WUG Ban! Shin Shou_****, but this will be the first that all of you will perform in front of an audience.**

YM: This really will be our first time... To be honest, I feel anxious.

**\-- Why?**

YM: This will be the first time we’ll perform on stage as the more experienced group. Usually, we’re the youngest and least experienced.

There’s the I-1 club in _Wake Up, Girls! Festa_. i☆Ris in _i☆Ris＆Wake Up, Girls! Valentine LIVE!!_. Even in other live shows, we’re surrounded by veterans.

Now that the tables are turned, I don’t know what’ll happen. That’s why I feel a little anxious. (laughs) But I guess I’ll never know for sure until it’s show time.

**\-- Well said. Have you started rehearsing?**

YM: We just started today. Because of the schedule, only Acchan (Atsugi Nanami) from RGR was there.

**\-- How was she?**

YM: She’s really good at dancing! I’ve seen the girls act during our dubbing sessions, and I’ve watched them from the sidelines performing in front of an audience. But this was the first time I’ve seen one of them in the middle of their lessons. I learned that she’s the type that stretches a lot before throwing herself to doing them. I got curious so I ended up watching her. (laughs)

\[The RGR girls did reference the times Mayu watched them perform, who afterwards gave them feedback and pointers on their stage performances and dances (iirc it was Agape and Tachiagare, Airi taught them Chikatetsu Labyrinth). Later on, Mayu would comment on their improvement next time she saw them in AnimeJAM.\]

**\-- I guess there’s a lot you can learn about someone while they rehearse. I’m looking forward to your joint performances. Also, I heard a lot of the previous outfits have been prepared for the event.**

YM: Yes. We’re going to switch outfits a lot more than we usually do.

![](/images/1523607538975-1.jpg)

**\-- Which among those is your favorite?**

YM: You can find my answer in the pamphlet. (laughs) It won’t have all of it but it will include photos of us in our favorite outfits.

**\-- How about your top picks?**

YM: Three of them come to mind.. Or not, I can’t really choose! They’re all great.

**\-- I get what you mean. Can you tell us the three you have in mind?**

YM: _Shoujo Koukyoukyouku_ (SKKK), _Tunago_, and _Polaris_. I feel that SKKK's was the first outfit that truly established us as a singing unit. Until then, our outfits were designed to be cute and with the anime in mind. Tunago's was the first outfit that incorporated our own ideas so it has a special place for me. Polaris and Beyond the Bottom's concepts are related in that it showcases aspects of our personal identity yet unites us as one.

**\-- I'm sure we'll know more about your choices in the pamphlet. Can you tell me about video messages going up on Twitter by the other cast members promoting the event?**  

YM: Oh, that! I'm very thankful for their support. I'm glad that they know a lot of our songs.

The results of the survey didn’t just include songs from the anime, it also had songs that we sung as WUG, the voice acting-idol unit. It brought home to me the fact that there are people out there who appreciate us as a singing unit, not just characters from the anime. It made me happy watching each and every one of the videos.

**\-- Noriko Hidaka \[Tange Junko\], Shintarō Asanuma \[Kouhei Matsuda\], Kenichi Suzumura \[Hayasaka Tasuku\], Yuka Ōtsubo \[Iwasaki Shiho\] and other cast members appeared in the videos. Among those, which would you want people to see?**

YM: It's hard to choose... but it has to be Shimono Hiro’s \[Kuniyoshi Ota\] (laughs). He's always over the top.

Oh, right! The outfit I'm wearing in the video will be featured in the pamphlet. I already mentioned my top picks so it’s going to be one of the three. Be sure to check it out.

**\-- Thank you for talking about GLFes. Moving on, this may be the first time someone asked you this but what is a live concert to you?**

YM: Before WUG, I used to hate them. I'm not good at singing in front of people. No one ever praised me for my signing, and my mother has very high standards because she used to be part of a band. So whenever we went to karaoke, rather than enjoying our time, they end up becoming more like tutoring sessions. (laughs)  
  
But through my experiences with WUG, I've come to enjoy singing and dancing in front of everyone.

\[She mentioned in an ANNi post-article that her younger brothers aren’t at the very least interested in her idol activities and had never gone to any of her shows, joking that when they do come and visit her in Tokyo, it’s mostly to clean up her often-neglected room.  
  
Her mother was the reason why she became good at singing. She recalled in a radio show that her mother is a great singer and used to be in a band since high school. Mayu wasn't a good singer but her mother pushed her to improve, citing that she didn't want a daughter who couldn't sing. They often got into fights as her mother trained her intensively and had her apply to auditions and competitions, where she would fail most of them until she passed the WUG audition.\]

**\-- Was it around the time WUG started its activities?**

YM: It came gradually. We had a rocky start. I honestly don't remember most of it now. Like our first showcase event, I don't remember anything past standing on stage. All I remember was being so nervous backstage that Emiri Katō-san \[Kondo Mai\] and Touko Machida-san \[Scriptwriter\] had to calm me down.

But it's all a blank by the time I stood on stage. It's the same for the live shows we had when we were new. But the experience from each show piled up and eventually I was able to look directly at the audience and even prepare spiels in-between songs. I started to feel alive on stage and began to enjoy it at its fullest.

I also began performing in theater plays at that time. I learned there how important it is to let your raw voice carry clearly throughout the hall and be audible to everyone. You also get direct feedback from the audience though their reactions, which is only something you can experience while being on stage. I found that sensation very enjoyable and made me want to do more of them.

As I gained more experience with live shows, I started to understand, in some way, why our fans weren’t getting excited. At the time, I wanted to become someone who can excite and engage the audience, so I pushed myself further because just getting to see everyone having fun makes it all worth it.

When it comes to live shows and stage plays, everyone lives in that shared moment. Everyone gets to directly experience each other’s emotions--their smiles, and their tears. I believe that being part of that is a profound experience. I want to keep chasing that sensation for as long as I can, that why I intend to stay on the stage. That's why I'm always thankful for everyone who had been supporting us. I was able to overcome my stage anxiety because of them.

**\-- You always express so much emotion on stage.**

YM: I always try my best not to cry, though. (laughs) I still remember it clearly. When we were just starting out and everyone was crying during a live show. I wasn't. Instead, I said on the mic, "I'm not going to cry here. The next time I cry is when WUG has truly ended."

I still keep those words close to me as a way for me not to cry. But I can't help but tear up whenever I see how much our fans care about us.

**\-- And that's why you let out all those emotions on stage.**

YM: Yes. It’s thanks to our fans that I’m not afraid of making mistakes anymore. I was before, but I realized that those “mistakes” are part of the fun of a live show.

**\-- I haven't heard you sing since the 3rd live tour, and hearing you now leaves a strong overpowering impression. What changed since then?**

YM: Thank you. I think it's because I finally became confident in myself. Of course, each WUG show was a learning experience but I've also performed solo and as part of other projects with different people, and there were always fans coming to cheer me on. Those experiences slowly gave me confidence which eventually developed into something else.

**\-- Since then, you were able to express yourself more in your singing.**

YM: Don’t take this the wrong way, but I think it's time for me to sing as myself instead of my anime persona. The voice acting unit was established as part of the anime series so Shimada Mayu is an important presence in my life. I always felt that I should sing songs the way she would sing it.

But I began changing that mindset around 2016. That’s not to say that I’ve completely separated myself from her. It’s more like I changed the way I approached our live shows as part of WUG.

I want others to appreciate us as WUG, the voice acting unit, and it’s something I’ve earnestly worked hard to achieve. And I'm sure are more people out there now who are curious as to how I, as Yoshioka Mayu, can pull that off in our live shows.

\[Since the first live tour, the girls would often comment about Mayu contributing something to their shows. The comedy skits for their Osaka shows (or just about anything skit-related for their events), shadow narrations, setlist choices (with Airi) for 4th live, etc.  
  
On her solo shows (or corners), she has a habit of changing plans mid-way, making it more elaborate or even harder, often saying that she's very grateful that the staff and the members were willing to play along and accommodate for it.\]

**\-- That’s something to look forward to. Finally, is there anything more that you want to tell us about GLFes?**

YM: So far, we’ve had a big concert at the end of the year as well as the live tour every summer as our usual staples. But this time we’ll have a big event where we’ll be performing with RGR, and our fans get to decide the setlist.

I'm really excited to see how our fans will react. I'm sure it won't be like our usual live shows so get ready to be surprised. I want it to be something fresh, and I also want them to looking forward to seeing WUG and RGR perform side-by-side on stage.

**\-- Sounds like it’s shaping up to be an event that new and old fans will enjoy.**

YM: It’s an event that should be welcoming to fans who will see us live for the first time. I’m confident that there will be a song that will resonate with them as a fan, and I feel that both old and new fans will find something to enjoy in their own way. It's a large venue but we will do our best to reach out to all of them. I’m looking forward to seeing you there and find out what songs we end up performing.

**\-- Thank you for joining me for this interview!**
