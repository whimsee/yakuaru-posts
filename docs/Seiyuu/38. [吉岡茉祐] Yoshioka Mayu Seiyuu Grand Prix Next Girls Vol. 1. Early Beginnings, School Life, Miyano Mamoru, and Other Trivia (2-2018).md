This feature interview is included in _Seiyuu Grand Prix Next Girls_ Volume 1, published in February 2018. Yoshioka Mayu shares anecdotes about her childhood and school life, how she discovered voice acting, her thoughts as the center of _Wake Up, Girls!_, and her goals for the future. Trivia questions are included at the end.

This is going to be note-heavy. I’ve translated much of her stuff and it’s kind of funny how things line up so I’ll fill in some blanks, and provide more anecdotes and trivia.

**I started acting early on in a theater group**

* * *

**\-- What kind of kid were you during kindergarten?**

**Yoshioka Mayu (YM):** My parents told me I was weird back then. (laughs) Like when my cousins used to get together at the start of the year, they’d bond over how much they love _Kamen Rider_ and there I was, a huge fan of _Cardcaptor Sakura_, genuinely believing that magic is real. I wouldn’t call myself unusual, but I did have some strange ideas.

\[Mayu is the oldest of her cousins and she often talks about one in particular, who is an anime otaku and often goes to her shows, and even gave her his Nintendo Switch so she could play _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_.\] 

**\-- You wanted to become a magician, then?**

**YM:** Well, back in kindergarten, I really didn’t give it much thought. Every year we’d write down who we wanted to become, and my answer changed every time. I wanted to run a cake shop, become a florist, things like that. Back then, I just went with what girls my age would think and what my classmates wrote. The first time I took it seriously was in third grade.

**\-- And what was that?**

**YM:** It’s a dream that I’m still pursuing: I want to work in the entertainment industry.

**\-- What brought that on?**

**YM:** I was taking acting classes in a workshop environment and my teacher said I was good at it. We were doing _Night on the Galactic Railroad_ and my teacher was a professional actor, or at least was doing that regularly, and that compliment really boosted my confidence so I started taking acting seriously.   

\[She often says that a good word goes a long way for her. It’s the same with her passion for writing, which she started in middle school because they liked what she wrote; and singing, which she initially hated essentially forced her to do it but came to love because people liked her voice.\]

**\-- When was that?**

**YM:** That was before I entered kindergarten…  I was around 4 when I joined the Osaka branch of the Himawari Theatre Group \[Blue Shuttle\]. Since my parents thought I was weird, they thought that enrolling me there would make me familiar with group environments. And once I learned how to work with people, I kept at it to learn in earnest.

**\-- What else did you study?**

**YM:** The ones I stuck to the longest were stage acting and classic ballet. I did both for about 15 years, up until my final year in high school as I was about to move to Tokyo.

**\-- It sounds like you enjoyed learning the performing arts, things that you can show to an audience.**

**YM:** You could say that. We’d have recitals for ballet, after all, where there’s a set theme and dancing is used instead of words to express yourself. It was right at that time that I really found what I wanted to become, which is probably why I kept doing it for so long.

\[She describes herself as someone who gets into a lot of interests, but rarely sticks to them for one reason or another. For things like manga, which she also doesn’t read often, she relies on recommendations. The only ones that stuck are those related to the performing arts, writing, and music.\]

**\-- What were you like during grade school?**

**YM:** I was pretty quiet during 1st and 2nd grade but once I entered 3rd and 4th grade, I somehow became quite outgoing, playing with the boys in our class, who would call me _anego_ \[big sis\]. (laughs) It was pretty much the same in 5th grade. By 6th grade though, as I became more self-conscious, I started making an effort to interact with girls.

**\-- Being that active, I can imagine you having student council roles as well.**

**YM:** I did a lot of that. President, vice president, I think I did all there was to do. (laughs) I guess a part of me really wanted to stand out and those roles made me feel like I was better than anyone. Well, I really enjoyed bossing people around, which probably reflected on my personality at the time.

**\-- You seem to like being the center of attention. Did that change when you entered middle school?**

**YM:** I still knew a lot of friends from grade school so nothing changed. I still bossed people around, taking on president or vice president roles. I was also part of four clubs, one of which I was pretty much acting vice president.

**\-- Four clubs?! What kinds of activities were you doing?**

**YM:** The one I was vice president for was the crafting club, a sort of a Home Economics club. We sewed, made sweets, and during our cultural festival we held a fashion show using western-style clothes that we made ourselves. I was also part of the girls’ tennis club, computer club, and the theater club, where I was a production assistant. 

\[The crafting club was referenced recently when she started making handmade masks out of handkerchiefs during the lockdown period. You can see how she did at tennis in _ワンアップ+ ～ Wake Up, Girls!編 〜_. \]

**\-- While we’re on the subject, how did you spend your time during middle school?**

**YM:** I chatted about anime with my friends. I think I was starting to learn about anime and anisong around that time. I was also getting into _Purikura_. We’d do things like meeting up after class at the arcade in front of the station to take pictures before heading home. I kept those pictures on special photo albums, which I still have at home. My friends wrote a bunch in them that I read from time to time. It’s a stark reminder that I really had so many friends back then.

\[In 鷲崎健のアコギFUN！(December 2019), she mentioned that her gateway to anisong was _K-ON!_\]

**\-- Did you become less active in high school?**

**YM:** Well, it really didn’t have anything to do with middle school, but once I entered high school, all of a sudden there was nothing for me to do. I probably looked like a completely different person to anyone who knew me in middle school. I went to a college prep school-type of place where I barely knew anyone so I focused on my studies, especially during my first year where my grades placed me 9th of the entire batch.

**\-- Was there a reason why you studied that hard to get into a prep school?**

**YM:** Going to college was on my mind at the time. My parents wanted me to get good grades so I could go to college, and as far as my parents were concerned, I had no choice on the matter. So I took the exam and studied diligently that first year… so much that clubs were out of the question.

**\-- That said, even without parents encouraging you, it takes a serious and persevering attitude to pull that off.**

**YM:** If you put it that way… I guess it makes sense. It doesn’t take much to influence me, my parents being a significant part of it.

 **Miyano Mamoru led me to voice acting**

* * *

![](/images/mRkIurRM-2.jpg)

**\-- In that case, when did you learn about voice acting as a profession?**

**YM:** It started with Miyano Mamoru. Around grade school, I became interested in his work as a stage actor, so I looked him up and to my surprise, I found out that he's primarily a voice actor. Anime was all the rage in middle school and when I got into anisong, it lead me to more anime. That’s how I really got into it and eventually brought voice actors into my awareness.

**\-- So what inspired you to become a voice actress?**

**YM:** I figured I should give it a shot since I haven’t yet. I never really learned how to act using only my voice. I’ve done all kinds of acting but with voice acting… there wasn’t really anything that led me into doing it.  
  
So that winter in my 2nd year of high school I auditioned for _Wake Up, Girls!_ (WUG) to learn how to do it and to try my hand at dubbing. If I didn’t pass, well, I probably wouldn’t be a voice actress right now.

\[The way she put it in other places is that the audition was one of her last big chances to break into the entertainment industry. Failing that would make her reconsider her future prospects and she would have simply stayed in Osaka, probably never moving to Tokyo, with acting as a side job.\]

**\-- This audition was a huge turning point for you, then.**

**YM**: I was about to give up at that point. (laughs) I learned to dance, and I thought I was the best during the Osaka screening. But at the final screening in Tokyo, I remember feeling overwhelmed because all of them were so charming. (laughs) You could tell they really wanted it.

\[This comment may also be because the rest of the applicants were plainly dressed to look more professional while she was, apparently per “Kansai tradition,” was dressed colorfully to stand out.\]

**\-- But then you passed that audition and started working as a voice actress in your 3rd year of high school. Since you’re the designated center of the group, did that make you self-conscious in any way?**

**YM:** It was on my mind all the time at first. I’m in the middle of the formation so I wanted to prove that I deserve to stand there. I used to feel that I had to be the one to set the pace, but now I don’t feel that way anymore and I’m happy to say that I’ve settled down.

I stopped thinking how a center should act because it’s about putting the enjoyment of the fans first and figuring out how to deliver a good performance that meets their expectations.

**\-- What kind of voice actress do you want to be?**

**YM:** I want to be someone who possesses a myriad of skills. Be it singing or stage acting, I want to keep doing things outside what is expected of voice actors. And while it’s not a lot, I’ve written scripts and song lyrics and I’d be great if I could get more opportunities to connect to my fans not just through my acting but also my writing.

\[Since then, she’s written more song lyrics, a reading drama (あの星に願いを), and some audio dramas (For show segments but notably, for a _Yuru Camp_ pilgrimage promo). She’s also written and produced a stage play (タツノオトシゴ) which is currently postponed due to COVID.\]

**\-- Now to close things out, tell us your aspirations and goals for the future.**

**YM:** First of all, I want to have a solo singing career by the time I'm 25. If that comes true, I want it to be something cool. Next, getting good at doing household chores. (laughs) I’m terrible at them and I want to overcome that as soon as I can. Lastly, I want to be a daughter who can make her parents happy. I don’t know how I’ll manage that but speaking for this interview struck me just how much they’ve influenced my life. So I want to repay them, whatever form it may take.

**\[Trivia Questions\]**

**Q: Do you have a nickname?**

A: I usually go by “Mayushii” and “Mayu” nowadays, but up until middle school it was “Yosshi”!

\[Incidentally, this nickname has been brought up occasionally. That’s what her friends back home in Osaka call her, commenting that Mayushii is such a weird nickname, and it is now her nickname in her radio show with fellow Osakan Aiba Aina, _相羽あいな・吉岡茉祐 あかんもんはあかん！_\]

**Q: In one word, how do you describe your personality?**

A: Boyish! Also, stubborn, uncompromising. Some have said I’m serious.

**What particular events make you happy?**  
A: Eating delicious food, and being absorbed in a video game at home.

\[While gaming is not a topic she often talks about, she has mentioned playing games alongside strategy guides (Pokemon and RE4) and, recently (circa 2019), soloing Monster Hunter: World through trial and error.\]

**Q: Do you have any friends in the industry?**  
  
A: Lately, I’ve been hanging out a lot with Yamashita Mami! She’s the first person I met up with when the new year came around. (laughs) I’m bandmates with her and Naganawa Maria in 4U so we often go out and eat after work! I’m also friends with Eitaso (Naruse Eimi) of _Dempagumi.inc_. We go out for karaoke to sing our favorite songs, including those from her group!

**Q: Bad habit you can’t seem to get rid of?**  
  
A: When I perform in concerts, I wave the mic around without actually meaning to. It happens a lot when I get really excited. And lately, I’ve been told that I’m freestyling too much in our dance and formations, and it’s probably because of the same thing. (laughs)

**3 Favorite Things**

1. **Music** - I think there hasn’t been a day that I didn’t listen to music! I do it so much that it quickly drains the battery of my phone. Music never fails to make the day better. If I go out for walks in winter while listening to music, it’s like I could feel my body heat up by 3 degrees.  
    
2. **Black clothes** - My eyes just go straight to them when I go shopping. I’m actually getting worried that I just wear black all the time… Some have demanded me to wear some other color even if I hate it. (laughs)  
    
3. **Perfume** - I like all kinds, ladies’ and men's! I have a weakness for good scents that I have a sizable stock of samplers to try at home!
