**\-- How’s it going for you lately now that you've finished high school and started working as a full-time voice actress?**  

Takagi Miyu (TM): Lately, I just go straight home after work. (laughs) I should have a lot of free time now that I don't have school anymore... but I also didn't have to do chores and cook for myself back then. My mom keeps telling me I should start being more feminine especially that I live by myself now. (laughs)  

**\-- Do you know how cook or do other household chores?**  

TM: I have to now so I've been looking into getting a portable stove!  

**\-- It sounds like you're really starting to enjoy it. Aside from that, what do you do in your free time?**  

TM: I play games, watch TV, and sleep!

**\-- This reminds me of what you said before that all you did during middle school was watch anime in the afternoons and play Touhou in the evenings.**  

TM: Yeah. (laughs) I need to take better care of myself now so I’m trying to sleep well... though that's really the only change I've made so far. (laughs) I always end up playing a game whenever I have time for myself!  

**\-- What games do you play?**  

TM: I’ve been playing _Sengoku Basara 4_, and Mahjong, as usual. I also play _Shironeko Project_. I'm also going through _Fate/stay Night Realta Nua_ on the PS Vita with the copy I borrowed from (Tanaka) Minami.  

\[Miyu stated in her 2014 All Night Nippon Mobile (ANNM) self-introduction that she got as high as 4th Dan in an online Mahjong league.  
  
Miyu and Mayu are fans of Sengoku Basara, though mostly the stage plays in Mayu's case. Whenever a new one comes out, both of them would eventually write about seeing it together. And around this point, Minami and Miyu started sharing PS Vita games (Fate and Little Busters).\]

**\-- That's a lot! What else are you into lately?**

TM: I’m trying to be more feminine so I started doing my nails! It was something I couldn't do in high school because it was prohibited but it's fun. I've been growing them out for about a month, applying treatment coating on them so they don't break. (laughs)  

**\-- Now that you’re cast as the lead in the anime adaptation of _Hackadoll_, how does it feel to work on a project that is different from _Wake Up, Girls!_?**  

TM: I'm so glad I got to work on this! I think it's a good thing because it's a new environment which means I get to do a lot of different things.

**\-- Your schedule must have been hectic though since it was going on at the same time as other events like Machiasobi.**  

TM: I've done a lot of events for Machiasobi, and it's always fun because I get to interact face-to-face with everyone. Now that the anime has started to air, I hope to hear about their impressions.  

**\-- The style of the choreography between WUG and Hackadoll feels different. Did you encounter any trouble trying not to get them mixed up during rehearsals and the show?**  

TM: We just shot the music video for Hackadoll and I have to say it's pretty surreal since we did it in a cyberspace-themed set. The movements imitate how androids would move, which is quite different from our WUG dances, so it wasn't that hard not to get them mixed up. Rather, it was quite fun.  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-06.jpg)

**\-- In your own words, can you give a quick summary about Okamoto Miyu as you see her now?**  

TM: Miyu gets presented as a bit of a hopeless airhead but I believe she's always been a passionate girl underneath. She’s in Tokyo during _Shadow of Youth_ (_Seishun no Kage_) where she decides to produce her own variety show. I imagine it's something she wouldn't have done before but it is undoubtedly a thing she can do now. She's always there with Minami-chan to brighten up the atmosphere, making her one of the moodmakers of the group.  

**\-- But how about you? What's your role in WUG?**  

TM: I don't know... We already have too many airheads that I wonder sometimes if they're just putting it on. (laughs) I mean, they even get fooled by the staff. I'm the youngest but I don't feel it at all, so sometimes I can't help but worry for them. (laughs)

\[Also in her ANNM self-introduction, she mentioned that she's actually the oldest out of her cousins and she revealed much later in the blog that she has a brother who is 11 years younger than her.\]

**\-- So you don't consider yourself an airhead?**  

TM: Not at all! There was a time though when I started eating right before our show in Sendai. (laughs) The other members might call this "Classic Miyu" but it was 5 minutes before showtime and I was feeling peckish. I think my hand just moved on its own because I started munching on popcorn before getting scolded by everyone. (laughs)  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-07.jpg)

**\-- Which I guess makes you a bit of a glutton, then. (laughs) How about Minami-san? What kind of member is she?**  

TM: She’s cool-headed and composed!  

**\-- In the previous interview, she said she's not like that because she tends to be very conscious and worry about things happening around her.**

TM: You can say that about everyone else in the group as well... (laughs). But I do think she and Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu) are the most level-headed. Next would be...  

**\-- I have a feeling you girls go through a lot with Yoppi as the leader since she's also quite a bit of a goof.**  

TM: Oh yeah, Yoppi's also up there! She's a different kind of airhead from Kaya, who I would call aloof... Our group really has all kinds, which makes it really fun! Before all this, I never imagined I'd meet people like them.  

**\-- What was your goal when you auditioned for WUG?**  

TM: I actually auditioned for the first Anisong Vocal Audition for i☆Ris before I tried out for WUG. That was my first audition. My friends figured we should take the opportunity and try out since we're all anime fans and we all dreamed of involving ourselves in the anime and games industry in whatever form it may take. Being a voice actress would be one of them, though I never really saw myself becoming one. But it was an open and free audition I figured so why not?

**\-- How did it go?**  

TM: I got as far as the final screening. Being there changed my perspective on things. I saw the applicants, who were around the same age, seriously trying their best and doing whatever they can to get into the same spot as everyone else and it lit a fire in me. I want to be like them too. I didn't want to lose to them. But I didn't want it hard enough and didn't know enough so after that I started seriously considering becoming a voice actress. Then a year later, I decided to audition for WUG.  

\[She was in the same group with Serizawa Yuu and Kubota Miyu in the final screening and she remarked that even then, they already left a strong impression which gave her the push she needed to improve and do better for the next audition which was for WUG.  
  
Yoppi also entered the 1st Avex x 81 Produce Vocal Audition, though she didn't mention how far she got.\]  

**\-- Was this also the year where you began athletic training by joining the track and field club?**  

TM: Yeah. To this day, I owe a lot to that. I lost weight and gained stamina because of it. Our training advisor, who kept a picture of us from before, said I changed a lot in the past year and that I've gotten in shape. So I'm really glad I did track.  

\[In the DDnavi interview, she mentioned that she was gaining weight because she got too into to games and anime, so she decided to quit ballet and join track to become more athletic.\]  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-08.jpg)

**\-- Really? All in one year?**  

TM: Yeah. A lot of people have told me that I've lost weight, which makes me kinda glad. (laughs) It wasn't like I set out to do it but I just stopped overeating. Then I just recently learned that I have a surprisingly weak stomach... which I guess kicked in pretty late. So I began being careful about overeating so I don’t get a stomach ache then I felt encouraged to stick with it once people started telling me that I've lost weight.

**\-- What aspirations did you have when you passed the audition and have you realized them since then?**  

TM: I did end up being in an anime so I got to achieve that dream! But working in this industry made me want to do more, be part of more projects, and get closer to veteran voice actors so I can learn from them.  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-09.jpg)

**\-- What did you learn working with those veterans, specifically Hidaka Noriko-san, Asanuma Shintarō-san from WUG and Yuzuki Ryōka-san from _Hackadoll_? Is there a recent experience that stood out for you?**  

TM: Lately, I've been working with Yuzuki-san, who voices Hacka Doll #0. Her role requires a powerful voice and that's really impressive because she's quite small in-person.  

**\-- You seem to be working pretty hard at every screening event since the release of _Shadow of Youth_.**  

TM: We've been trying our best to not spoil anything so I'm relieved that we finally get to talk a lot about it. Every screening event is a blast and it always feels too soon when it ends.  

**\-- How many screenings are there?**  

TM: We've been to Sendai, Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, and then there's Osaka next week. All in all, there should be ten screenings.  

**\-- The one in Shinjuku had a live performance, which I imagine was a new challenge for you.**  

TM: Yeah. It was in TOHO Cinemas Shinjuku and we did a performance right in front of their projection screen! We had no idea how that would work but it was an experience performing and feeling the audio reverberating inside the theater.  

**\-- Speaking of which, I believe their cinema halls are among the best in the industry.**  

TM: I totally get why! You could feel the sound bouncing around the hall. Normally, I prefer clear audio because the echoes can really blow out certain sounds, which would force me to sing better. (laughs) It's a new experience for us and it feels like a fitting transition from having just seen the movie to watch us perform the same song live.  

**\-- Now that you can freely talk about it, can you give your impression about _Shadow of Youth_?**  

TM: My favorite parts are the various exchanges between Miyu-chan and Kaya-chan. They’re so good!  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-10.jpg)

**\-- Sounds like those two get along pretty well.**  

TM: Yeah! Those two are like the Straight - Funny comedic pair in the TV series. This time though, I'm happy to see Miyu getting to talk back and Kaya being a little more playful. It's a sign of how close they've gotten.  

**\-- Since _Shadow of Youth_** **is about the girls overcoming the challenges of being in Tokyo, how much does it compare to your experiences balancing work and WUG activities?**  

TM: I’ve gotten mostly used to it now, but my first time doing a radio show was nerve-racking; I couldn't manage to talk while sticking to a script. I had a lot of tough first experiences back then but somehow I always find a way to overcome its challenges. The first live tour was obviously rough on us physically but it was also hard finding the words to say during MC segments. We always ended up having dead air after each of us spoke.

**\-- It was like all of you were hoping for someone else to speak.**  

TM: Right. It's something that always bothered me so I proposed that we decide who gets to talk for those beforehand. Having that delegated really put me at ease. (laughs)  

**\-- Since _Shadow of Youth_** **explores deeper about the connections tying each of the characters together, can you tell me your impression about Hayasaka-san?**  

TM: He's really cool! You can really see how much he cares and dotes on his “little potatoes” (Hayasaka-san's nickname for WUG). He kept the out-of-place Musubimaru dolls in his otherwise perfectly normal room, and there's a scene in the restaurant where he talks about WUG while eating potatoes. And of course, there's also the scene at the end involving _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku_ (SKKK) where he acted all cool while also hiding his concern for them.  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-011.jpg)

**\-- He came to the rescue in the nick of time and provided lyrics for the song.**  

TM: Exactly! It’s both sneaky but cool of him to do that.  

**\-- How about for Shiraki-san, President Tange and Matsuda-san, the adults that have always been with the girls?**  

TM: The dialogue between Shiraki-san and President Tange was memorable to me because the mood was pretty surreal. It gave a bit of insight regarding President Tange, who used to be part of Saint40 (An idol group Shiraki-san used to manage), which might affect how things will go in the second movie. Also, President Tange sounding somber and calm wasn’t something you normally see.  

**\-- It was a surprise that she didn't just barge in there to settle things with her fists.**  

TM: Yeah. You can imagine a situation like her and Kaya barging into the bvex studio, threatening everyone with a glare.

**\-- How did the recording for Shiraki-san and President Tange scene go?**  

TM: It's impressive to watch how Mitsuru Miyamoto-san and Hidaka-san are on a completely different level from the rest of us! Shiraki-san has some difficult and lengthy lines but Miyamoto-san would always go over each of them carefully before the session and he has tons of notes written down on his script. I want to be that kind of professional as well.  

**\-- I-1 Club's seems to be getting more active as well.**  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-11.jpg)

TM: Mokacchi and Shiho-chan's so intense! I already imagined that the outcome of their dispute is going to be tragic, no matter what happens, but it’s hard imagining that with the I-1 voice cast since they’re really fun and friendly and not as scary in real life. (laughs)  

**\-- Who's your favorite I-1 club member?**  

TM: Oh! Hmm... I'm leaning toward Moka-chan and Nanokasu. The confident way Moka-chan speaks is cute but I was rooting for Shihocchi during their dispute because she went out of her way to help Yoppi when she got injured, all while keeping up her mean facade. Then again, I like Moka-chan's desire not to lose to her so I don't know. (laughs) For Nanokasu, I think of her as I-1's Miyu because they're doing similar roles.  

**\-- That's unexpected. In what way are they similar?**  

TM: They don't have the same personality but I think they have the same knack for gathering information.  

**\-- I see! Nanoka is good at analyzing while Miyu's internet savvy and knows how to round up rumors and gossip.**  

TM: Just like informants do which is why I think they're similar.

**\-- How were the I-1 cast during recording sessions and live performances?**  

TM: What stood out for me in last year's concert in Makuhari \[Festa 2014\] is, despite their busy schedules, they all came together before the show and focused hard on making a good show. That and they're really good at exciting the audience. It just goes to show we still have a long way to go before we can reach their level. At our recording sessions, they're really friendly and encouraging, and they really make give the studio a friendly atmosphere.  

**\-- What kind of things do you talk about?**  

TM: A lot of girl talk like western fashion and such! One in particular was (Yuka) Ōtsubo-san's fondness for Baumkuchen. (laughs) They're really kind. They always bring food to the studio and we get to relax and unwind together.  

**\-- Now with _Shadow of Youth_** **wrapped up, I want to ask about the second movie. How did the recording go?**  

TM: We took a bit of a break after we recorded _Shadow of Youth_ so I asked Director Yamamoto for pointers and he told me that I should focus on her role as the moodmaker of the group. She never gets fazed by anything and she can brighten up any situation, so he told me to embody that quality in her. The previous movie tackled Nanami-chan's situation and anxieties and that will carry over into the next movie so it's up to Miyu-chan to be that positive force.  

![](/images/spe-1510301800-12.jpg)

**\-- How have you been recently, now that the summer events with the live tour and Anisama (Animelo Summer Live) are over?**  

TM: My schedule is just as packed since then. (laughs) I went to the Kyoto International Manga and Anime Festival, Tokyo Game Show, and the screening events for _Shadow of Youth_.

**\-- How about the live tour? Did anything there stand out for you?**  

TM: _Sugao de KISS ME_ is an odd song because everyone who saw the movie, us included, felt that it was a huge departure from WUG's usual style. But I guess we ended up surprising a lot of people when they saw us performing it live because they started really getting into it.  

**\-- Out of all the new songs for that tour, what stood out to me was the one where you were the center,** **_Seventeen Crisis_****.**  

TM: I’m so glad I got to take on that role! I also got a lot of singing parts. It's physically demanding especially that it comes after _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_ but we were able to manage it. It's a cute and catchy song so just getting to sing it is a joy.  

**\-- I've heard all the members say how** **_7 Girls War_** **is a difficult song for them. How about** **_Seventeen Crisis_** **since you seem to have it hardest?**  

TM: I don’t think that’s the case. _Seventeen Crisis_ is supposed to be a dance-heavy performance, much like how Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) and Minyami's (Tanaka Minami) _Platinum Sunrise_ is mainly a vocal showcase, so we could show everyone how much we can do. In that sense, I'm pretty glad I got to be the center for _Seventeen Crisis_ because from the audience's standpoint, having me, being the tallest, as the center gives the unit a good visual balance.  

**\-- I keep hearing from the other members that the best version of** **_Platinum Sunrise_** **was in Sendai. I want to ask you that for** **_Seventeen Crisis_****. How did it go during the tour?**  

\[According to Yoppi and Minami, 2nd tour's _Platinum Sunrise_ performance was kind of a curse because every show they would mess up, forget lyrics, or fail to sync well and it wasn't until Maihama when they finally started getting it right.\]  

TM: I was nerve-racking showing it for the first time in Osaka, especially that we haven't perfected managing our stamina yet.  

**\-- It kind of seemed that was the general consensus in Osaka. (laughs)**  

TM: Right! It felt just like how we overexerted ourselves last year. But we figured we have experience on our side this time, and I was especially excited in Maihama, since it's in my hometown of Chiba.

**\-- Speaking of which, didn't you say in Sendai that Eino-san wasn't the only one from there?**  

TM: I was originally from Sendai which also makes it my hometown! My dad moved to Chiba when I was three years old because of his job but I get to visit my grandmother whenever we go to Sendai since she's from Ishinomaki.  

**\--  I imagine how special it is that you get to perform at such a large hall in Sendai.**  

TM: Yes... I got to sing WOO YEAH! and there's a line in the song calling out to an imaginary audience in a huge hall, but I altered the lyrics to give appreciation to everyone who came to see us since it was a large venue that went up to the third floor.  

**\-- Yamashita-san (Nanami) mentioned something like that as a memorable moment.**  

TM: They even told me that it got them very emotional.  

**\-- Did you originally plan on doing that or was it spur of the moment?**  

TM: It just came to me when I stood on stage during the afternoon show and realized that there was a third floor. So I decided to do it on the night show since it would make for a wonderful moment to cap off the end of the tour, and I can finish without any lingering regrets.  

**\-- You girls brought in a lot of ideas for this year's tour.**  

TM: We did! We wanted to make it exciting for the audience with the new songs and such. Especially in Sendai, where we felt everyone's love and appreciation.  

**\-- Speaking of grand experiences, you also got to perform in Anisama (Animelo Summer Live 2015) this year. How did that go?**  

TM: Coming off from our second tour then straight to Anisama, I can say that it's quite a different experience compared from last year. Of course, there's that incident last time involving Minami's mic and a few other things we felt needed improvement, but this year we were all smiling on stage as gave our best performance, and I'm really glad that we finished feeling the same way.

**\-- I'm sure a lot of people got to see SKKK for the first time.**  

TM: We showed it off during the tour but _Shadow of Youth_ hadn't come out yet so we were concerned about the audience's reaction. But we were really happy once we entered the stage and saw the entire arena lighting up with our color as though they're eagerly welcoming us.  

\[The album for SKKK just came out a week before Anisama and they mentioned in the blog how happy they were that everyone enjoyed it and even prepared calls for it.\]  

**\-- Those military-style costumes looked great on you and Aoyama-san.**  

TM: Thank you! I'm really fond of that costume too.  

**\-- What do you think about the venue itself? Did its size intimidate you or were you even conscious of it?**  

TM: It was like I was in outer space and it's hard to imagine that the entire place was packed with people from end to end.  

**\-- You only got to perform on the main stage last year but it was different this time. How did it feel to be on the center stage?**  

TM: Being surrounded by the audience like that is so cool! They're so close to you that you can see their faces and I was even surprised to see some of them wearing WUG shirts. It's so motivating and I'm glad we got to experience that.  

\[Another anecdote they mentioned in the blog is that they realized during rehearsals how little time they actually had during Tachiagare's intro to reach the center stage so they practically ran after Minami's cue.\]  

**\-- Let's go off on a tangent for a moment and talk about GRANRODEO's performance. Were you able to watch their gimmick on stage involving those scantily-clad ladies?**  

TM: Yes! We were all getting ready for the finale so everyone got to watch it on the monitor. Everyone was going crazy, wondering what was going on, and when they got back, we gave them a huge applause! (laughs)

**\-- How about the theme song finale?**  

TM: It was like I'm dreaming! I was with my favorite artists and this time we got to sing three parts. It was trying to take everything in while we sang. We actually drew lots to determine who gets to do it.  

**\-- I never would have thought since the ones who got to sing were the huge anisong fans.**  

TM: Yeah! Me, Minami and Yoppi!  

**\-- Now with that wrapped up on a good note, what do you hope to do if you had the chance to perform there again?**  

TM: I always wanted to do a collaboration, if that's possible. Or... (whispered voice) A Hackadoll Anisama debut, maybe? (laughs)  

\[WUG got to do a collaboration In Anisama 2017, where they performed _One in a Billion_ with May’n as Wake up, Mayn!\]  

**\-- I heard that Director Yamamoto gave you girls high praise during one of the screenings. That you've come more into your own as voice actresses and idols.**  

TM: Honestly, I was very happy to hear that! And like everyone else, equally surprised. Maybe he's really a softie inside. (laughs) We worked really hard to improve in our second year as WUG and we wanted to show everyone that progress in the movies.  

**\-- Finally, with the next movie coming out and more WUG activities coming with it, I want to ask what you're looking forward to.**  

TM: There's a lot of story threads going on as we reach the second movie. There's Nanami's and Miyu's story, I-1 club's dispute and, the relationship between Shiraki-san and Tange-san, so don't miss it. As WUG, we still have one big event on December 12 \[WUG Festa 2015 Beyond the Bottom EXTEND\], and we want to make it the best to show everyone how much we've improved over the whole year. As for me, I will keep challenging myself and improve with Okamoto Miyu-chan by my side as we aim higher.
