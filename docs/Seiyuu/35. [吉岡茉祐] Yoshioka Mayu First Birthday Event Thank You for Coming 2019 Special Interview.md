Yoshioka Mayu is a voice actress who debuted in 2013 with the role of Shimada Mayu for the anime _Wake Up, Girls!_. She was also the center of the unit _Wake Up, Girls!_ that has disbanded following their final concert at the Saitama Super Arena (SSA) and since then, she has been pursuing a fresh start in her solo career as both a voice actress and performer.

Yoshioka Mayu’s first birthday event _Thank You For Coming! 2019_  will be held at Sanrio Puroland in November 17, 2019. It will be hosted by Tanaka Minami with Fujita Akane as the invited guest.  

In this interview, Yoshioka Mayu talks about the ideas she had in mind for her birthday event, her intentions for the event, and the eventful months following her fresh start.

* * *

**— Congratulations on your first birthday event.**

**Yoshioka Mayu (YM):** Thank you. It’s a completely new challenge for me so I’m excited.

**— What comes to mind when you think of birthday events?**

**YM:** I think of them more as celebratory events that idols usually hold close to their birthday. It’s something my senior colleagues from _i☆Ris_ normally did so it’s not something people expect me to do.  
  
That said, what usually happens is if there’s an event close to your birthday, it’s guaranteed that fans will go there to celebrate and greet you. So I figured how great it would be to have a place where we could get together and do that just. I’ve always thought about holding an event where I could express myself as a voice actress through singing, acting, and anything else I have in mind. And it’s thanks to the connections I’ve had over the years that this is now possible.

**— It’s been about six months since the final concert of _Wake Up, Girls!_** **at SSA. How has it been for you in regards to your solo activities?**

**YM:** I guess you could say I was soul-searching as I tried different things but I was actually surprised to realize how much I could already do. My time in WUG got me to do all sorts of things so if I add that to the various experiences I’ve been having since then, I’m feeling good for this second chapter of my career.

\[“Second Chapter” was coined by Aoyama Yoshino (Yoppi) during WUG Final Live. It meant that even though WUG has ended, it’s only the start of a new beginning for everyone.\]

**— Heard that you wrote the script for the reading drama あの星に願いを \[EN: _When You Wish Upon a Star_\] that will be presented on November 6-10.**

**YM:** It came about because the director \[Tanabe Toshiki\] and I were in constant talks about wanting to do a stage play together. Just like with my birthday event, it shows how important it really is to keep in touch with people. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to be a scriptwriter for a play that people will experience so I encourage everyone to check it out and give me feedback. I’ll be looking forward to it.

\[According to her explanation in a MyCloset broadcast, it started after she performed in toshiLOG’s first reading drama さよならのかわりに in March 2018. The director approached her about producing a show with her as the scriptwriter. It took about a year to finish the draft and the rest was polish and preparation.\]

**— It’s interesting seeing Aoyama Yoshino-san as part of the cast.**

**YM:** Actually, when I was writing the script, I often went over it with my fellow WUG members because they always provide interesting feedback. I think it’s a good idea to include someone like Aoyama who knows how I wrote it as it provides another way for the audience to appreciate it.

\[While Mayu only had a small part casting roles for the reading drama, Yoppi was her personal recommendation since she often talked with Yoppi about her writing projects and Yoppi had at one point approached Mayu to write something for her. She jokingly admitted that Yoppi might not be a good fit for the role but was relieved to be proven wrong.\]

**— Let’s talk about you as a voice actress. Can you tell me about your role as _Cop Craft_****’s Tilarna Exedilica because it seemed to be a perfect match for you.**

**YM:** It’s very encouraging to me that the anime roles I’ve gotten so far are in various genres. My manager was so happy when she told me the results of the audition. It made me really glad not only for that but also because it can be worrying knowing how difficult it could be to land roles outside of what people know you can do so getting a role where I can express myself in a different way is very fortunate.

**— I was surprised to hear that you’ll be in the upcoming _Project Sakura Wars_** **as Saijou Itsuki.**

**YM:** I’d like to think this is because I had previously worked with the composer of the series, Tanaka Kouhei, that I got involved with his project. This got me closer to my family as well; my parents don’t much about anime but they were the happiest out of everyone when they heard the news since they know about _Sakura Wars_. It has a powerhouse cast especially with last month’s announcement of Mizuki Nana-san and Kugimiya Rie-san being in it. It made me so anxious wondering why they decided to follow up something that impressive with mine. (laughs)

**— Ever since your voice acting debut, summers for you used to be very busy as you did live tours across the country. I’d like to know how it’s been for you to have a summer without one.**

**YM:** It feels strange that I’m not performing in a concert. My body gets restless where I just want to sing and dance. The mini-concert for _Cop Craft_ came at just the right time and it reminded me how much I enjoyed doing it. (laughs) So if there’s ever a chance, you can count on me wanting to do it.

**Expressing Her Past and Future**

**— When I think of a Yoshioka Mayu-organized event, a lot of things come to mind such as reading dramas, drawing sessions, even character song concerts. I’d like to know the concept you have for this event.**

**YM:** Since we’re holding two sessions in one day, I want each of their concepts to be different; the afternoon session will be about who I’ve been so far, while the evening session will be about who I want to become moving forward. That goes for the songs I’ll sing as well; I want to sing covers or songs that I’ve sung but that depends on the concept. That way, each show will be entirely different.

**— What are you planning to do in regard to these concepts?**

**YM:** I’d like to use this as an opportunity to talk about things that I haven’t had the chance to open up about. I’ve never had many chances to talk about who I was before I became part of WUG. WUG played a huge part in shaping who I am now but many other things also happened before that and I want this event to be the place where I could tell people about it.

**— How about the evening session? Can you talk a little about how you plan to express who you want to become?**

**YM:** I have all sorts of ideas in mind. It’s starting to come together now that we’re heavily in the middle of preparation but the message that I want to convey is “This is who I want to become.” The things I aspire to do are very diverse so I’d like everyone to know about them with the hope that it’s something they would like.  
  
I believe that unless you put it into words, the things you wish to do will never be realized. I’d like to think that when the time comes and it does come true in some event, people will be there to witness it. So I hope they listen to what I have to say. All in all, it’s going to be a casual affair, so I’d like everyone coming into it to feel as if I just invited them into my home.

**— Did you also invite Tanaka Minami-san as the host and Fujita Akane-san as the guest?**

**YM:** I did. Right from the start, I wanted to work with people I’m close with. Tanaka Minami had been with me since WUG so she knows about my entire life as a voice actress and I imagine it would lead to some nostalgic anecdotes. Akane-chan knows about my life outside WUG and since she follows my radio shows, I feel that our chemistry can relate to a fan’s perspective.

**— I don’t think I need to ask about Tanaka-san but I am curious as to how you met Fujita-san.**

**YM:** I’m fairly sure we first met each other around the time of _Wake Up, Girls! Shadow of Youth_ because she voiced a character there but we really hit it off during the recording of RELEASE THE SPYCE. Since then, we’ve gone out to eat and do things together, sometimes with Naganawa Maria-san, who happens to be a common close friend of ours.

**— I’m also curious if you like Sanrio since the event will be held at Sanrio Puroland.**

**YM:** I don’t know that much about the characters themselves but I adore Kiki and Lala (Little Twin Stars). I’ve always been a fan of character duos so it’s a plus that they’re really cute as well. There used to be a collaboration between them and _Cardcaptor Sakura_ and I bought so much merchandise once it came out!

**— Have you ever been to Sanrio Puroland?**

**YM:** It actually went there for the first time to do the photoshoot. It feels poetic because I go to the Keio-Tama Center pretty often for Mister Donut, Saizeriya, and Nitori.

**— How did the shoot go?**

**YM:** I entered through the back entrance instead of the front. (laughs) It feels like an achievement though to finally get inside the building I often see from afar.

**— The outfits look pretty cute.**

**YM:** I… picked them! I wanted it to match the place which meant my regular clothes were out of the question so I decided that an outfit would be best. I’ve always wanted to know how it feels to be in that world and it was magical!

**— What’s your personal highlight of the shoot?**

**YM:** I was ecstatic that I was able to take pictures with Kiki and Lala. Seeing them felt like I was suddenly in a dream, that I was in Puroland. It was so wonderful.  
  
We also took pictures in Hello Kitty’s house and there they were being so cute as they beckoned me in.

**— Do you have memories of going to amusement parks and other places?**

**YM:** When I was little, we used to go on trips to different places. We couldn’t do it anymore once I started going to school and things became busy. I’m glad I got this opportunity to visit because I would have seen things differently, which just shows how a place could also grow and change. I’m excited to know what the fans and I will see during the event so that years into the future we can do it again and realize what has changed since then.

**— Lastly, can you give a message for the readers.**

**YM:** This event is not only a place to celebrate my birthday. It’s also an opportunity for me to introduce myself once again to everyone. I hope that we’ll have a good time as I show both old fans and new, especially those who have never gone to events, who I am. There’s a “2019” on the title because I want it to continue onward.  
  
I imagine a lot of you reading this already know about me so I hope you’re excited with what you’ve learned. And for those who have yet to know me, this is also for you and I hope can find something to take an interest in. I’ll see you all there!
