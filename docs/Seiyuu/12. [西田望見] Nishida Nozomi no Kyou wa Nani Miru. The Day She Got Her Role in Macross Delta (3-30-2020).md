I'm not exactly sure where to fit this but every once in a while I stumble across something I want to translate. In this case, it's not often you read about a seiyuu candidly opening up about these things so it's worth doing.

**“Why I wanted to be a voice actress.”**

Good day, everyone! Nishida Nozomi here.

We’ve been seeing news about schools cancelling their graduation and entrance ceremonies in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus. April, however, has always been the season of new beginnings for a lot of us, so for this post I figure I should write about why I aspired to be a voice actress.

I wanted to be a manga artist when I was in grade school since I’ve been a fan of manga and anime since I was little. I wasn’t any good at drawing though… and try as I might, I never got any better. So I gave up on that frivolous pipedream by the time I graduated. I then aspired to be a college student. It’s not what you’d call an occupation, which makes me wonder why I chose it back then but I probably just wanted to pick a goal that was attainable.

In middle school, having a career as a voice actress didn't cross my mind. In fact, I wasn’t any good in front of crowds. Just the thought of acting in front of one would have been ridiculous as it would have embarrassed me to death, so I could never imagine myself as one whenever I watched TV documentaries about voice actors.

Around that time I was also a massive otaku of anything shinsengumi and chuunibyou. The shinsengumi was being featured in NHK’s Taiga drama broadcasts and I really got into Chrono Nanae’s _Shinsengumi Imon Peace Maker_. I enjoyed the story, which was a mix of actual events coupled with original ideas and there was action as well as personal drama. The best part of it was Chrono-san’s depiction of the soldiers who were well-characterized and were so charming that it was hard to pick a favorite. Mine was Hijikata Toshizō.

I may have been a middle school student at the time but in my heart it was like I was living there and I truly wished it had been the case. It was purely indulgent thinking but I can’t belittle that part of my life because perhaps I may be channeling that to my work now. lol 

Then I entered high school where I went through the first two years hiding the fact that I’m an otaku. At the time, _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_ was really big. My seatmates would gush about it and I’d just go, “wow, there’s an anime like that? That’s cool!” As that side of me started to show during my third year, though, I got scolded by my then-seatmate for being a huge liar.

**Getting into _Macross Frontier_ and _Clannad_**

I left my hometown of Gifu for Tokyo in my first year of college and it was there where I finally considered becoming a voice actress. I had always been a big fan of _Macross Frontier_ but until then I only cared about the anime rather than the voices behind it.

Then one day I watched a video of a _Macross Frontier_ concert and it captivated me. What moved me was that, through these concerts and events, they were able to convey the essence of the anime by way of song and dance. I wanted to see it for myself so with the help of my friend, I was able to get into the _Giragira Summer_ event. That experience sparked my interest in voice acting and the way I approached media completely changed since then.

While _Macross Frontier_ introduced me to the idea of voice actors who sing and perform in concerts, it was _Clannad_ that got me into its acting aspect. It is an anime adaptation of a PC game but I cried buckets over it. It featured students and adults as characters and the story even touched upon fatherhood as part of one’s life. The school life aspect of the story was great and tear jerking in its own right, but it was the story of how being a father could be painful, sad, and bitter all at once is what really did me in.

Kōrogi Satomi’s performance of Ushio practically stole my heart. She’s an adult who could portray a child that was true to life, especially one that wore her emotions on their sleeve and whose voice had a peculiar nasal quality, where I deeply felt every shift in emotion. As a college student, it shook me how something like that made me cry so much, which then got me crying even more.

CLANNAD got me to seriously consider involving myself in the kind of work that can move people. Just like that I began searching the internet about getting into voice acting; I looked for voice acting schools and dug around for magazine articles that had information about it. It was in the middle of job hunting season. It came late but that’s how I started working toward my dream.

It would have been ideal if it were easy-going from there on out… but it was a long and rough road over many years.

**I considered giving up so many times...**

There was a time when I felt dismayed if I could even achieve my dream especially that, year after year, voice actors who debuted were increasingly getting younger. Getting older is something I should be glad about but I had wished I wouldn’t get any older. There was even a time when I couldn’t pay for gas heating and had to take cold showers. There were so many times that I considered giving up if I reached a certain age and didn’t get any work.

But I kept going because I love acting. I even thought of escaping to somewhere far away and in my despair, it was going to be a trip to Russia when I received messages from colleagues who had gone to a studio to audition for _Macross Delta_. On the way to the audition, I told myself not to get my hopes up, that I’d fail anyway.

2 weeks passed when I received a message one evening as I was backstage counting tickets and helping out with meal preparation:

“You passed the audition for Makina Nakajima in _Macross Delta_!”

I still remember how my entire body was shaking. How it seemed like the whole world was spinning. I thought it had to be a dream so I slapped my face just to make sure and even then I still couldn’t believe it. It’s still vivid to me how shaky my hands were when I called home and told them about the news.

Because that’s how I got my start as a voice actress.

Now I’m doing voices in anime, foreign movies, and games. I also sing in other works, and I even have my own column where I’ve written a lot about my motorcycle hobby. I’m sure there are people out there with opinions about what a voice actor should be. But for me, my goal is to become one who can bring joy to people, no matter how little it may be, and I’d love it if I could share that sense of enjoyment with everyone in the things I work on.

This is what I, Nishida Nozomi, would like to pour all my effort into achieving moving forward as a voice actress!
