**\-- Didn’t you and Aoyama-san just move to Tokyo like the girls did in _Wake Up, Girls! Shadow of Youth (Seishun no Kage)_****?**  

Eino Airi (EA): Yes. I always wanted to try living on my own due to my experiences commuting to and from the university from my home in Sendai. This probably wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for Wake Up, Girls! so I'm glad to have the opportunity. (laughs)  

**\-- How is it going so far?**  

EA: It's so liberating! I can do whatever I want but I also have to deal with all the necessary things on my own, like household chores.  

**\-- Wasn't it during the summer last year when you and Aoyama-san were roommates for the tour?**  

EA: That brings back a lot of memories! Actually, Yoppi (Aoyama Yoshino) and I talked about that recently. It was a fun time for both of us.  

\[Yoppi (Airi to a lesser extent coming from Sendai) had trouble early on (2013 to early 2015) because she had to move back and forth from Kumamoto for WUG activities. She went to fewer events back then (and also had fewer job opportunities, though she did get work based in Kumamoto) so the other members covered for her solo parts in songs, or she contributed after the fact. She later stated in another interview that it was because of that she always aims to make any and all appearances and jobs she gets matter, no matter how small.\]

**\-- What do you mean by that? (laughs)**  

EA: I mean living together with Yoppi was a blast.  

**\-- Ah. I heard she's not the type to share a bath with someone, among other things.**  

EA: I even teased if we could go to a public bath instead. (laughs)  

**\-- Do you cook for yourself? I heard that you weren’t able to back then.**  

EI: There's a supermarket close to where I live so I try to when I have time.  

**\-- What are your staple dishes?**  

EA: I cook dishes that I usually prefer eating. It's been warm lately so I want to prepare simple dishes like tomato salad with a large serving of soup. I try to eat healthily. (laughs). Though lately, I’ve been getting home late and sore all over because of the tour and rehearsals so I only get to prepare whatever comes to mind.  

**\-- What was going through your mind when you made the decision to move to Tokyo, especially with the summer packed with live events and the tour?**  

EA: Last year, with the anime series and the tour wrapped up, I thought maybe things were winding down WUG-wise. At the time, we were still wondering how the series would progress so I was glad when I heard talks about the movie because that meant more WUG activities. And as summer drew closer, there were actually more and more activities in store for us so I was very happy and excited.

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c002.jpg)

**\-- I imagine it must have been hard for a voice actor living in Sendai to audition for roles. Were you also feeling impatient and restless?**  

EA: Of course. Yoppi and I were in the same situation and we often console and encourage ourselves through LINE, telling each other that we can't rush things and that we still have personal obligations to fulfill at the time, like graduate from our respective schools.  

**\-- Were you able to graduate without any issue?**  

EA: Yes, I did.  

**\-- What did you write for your graduate thesis?**  

EA: It was a study about life and death based on Soren Kierkegaard's _The Sickness Unto Death._  

\[Airi also mentioned in the blog that she learned a bit of Latin during her Philosophy studies. She chose to take up the subject when she tried to read one of Kierkegaard's works but couldn't understand it. However, it interested her enough to study it and ended up enjoying it.\]  

**\-- Kierkegaard’s works are a popular subject for those interested in Philosophy, isn't it?**  

EA: It is and I got to write about something I wanted to work on. Our professor suggested that we focus on one aspect of philosophy, rather than study it as a whole. So for my graduate thesis, I decided to go in-depth on a single book, which was a fun experience.  

**\-- You sound like you really enjoyed college life.**  

EA: I really did. It was a lot of fun. (laughs) I used to go over the word limit every time I write papers.

**\-- Now, let's go ahead and talk about Hayashida Airi. How would you describe her now?**  

EA: When I first saw her design, she looked the most plain out of everyone and she had a gloomy air about her, which I thought didn't suit me. I'm not like that so I was unsure how to portray her. But as I got more opportunities to portray her and learn about her, I was surprised to realize that she isn't actually like that.  
  
She's unexpectedly optimistic. She has an unassuming presence but she's the glue that keeps the group together. She loves everyone and WUG and cares about them the most. She is a strong girl who sees everything, the good and the bad, and does her best to never waver and give in to negativity.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c010.jpg)

**\-- When you put it that way, it almost sounds like you're describing yourself.**  

EA: Hearing me say it sounds strange, though. (laughs) Whenever I talk about how different me and Airi are, the other members often point out that I'm just like her in that I always take in everything around me and consider everyone's opinions... which I couldn't help but agree. I think it gave me a different perspective because it might have influenced how I portray her now.  

**\-- What about your portrayal of her changed the most?**  

EA: I used to play her as a gloomy character but now I include a touch of gentleness to her lines and imagine her as someone who always keeps the other members' feelings into consideration when she talks. I think of her as a regular hard working girl who takes things one step at a time, always optimistic and perceptive of everything around her.  

**\-- How did you carry that personal growth for** **_Seishun no Kage_****'s recording?**  

EA: It has been a while since the anime series so we were a little uncertain if we could still portray our respective roles the way we did so I decided to rewatch the entire thing. Because of that, I was able to get into character smoothly without any glaring issues.  
  
It was a relief because all of us gained valuable experiences working in different projects that I felt the pressure to improve. That being said, Hayashida Airi is a character I best know how to portray, so I wasn't as nervous as before and I even felt like I've improved a little because I was able to comfortably act as her.  

**\-- How about the other members? Did you notice them improve?**  

EA: It's hard to imagine that it's only been almost a year because they seem like different people now. We were a bit of a mess when we were starting out; we were more conscious about handling the mic than our actual acting. But now everyone is focused on acting and personally, I think it had gotten easier to do.  

**\-- Wasn't it being recorded right around the time you moved to Tokyo?**  

EA: It was three days after I had just moved in and my room was as bare as it could be. (laughs)  

**\-- Now that I think about it, you experienced the same thing the girls in the anime did, since they also just moved to Tokyo.**  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c003.jpg)

EA: It was just like that so I felt empathy for them, which helped with my performance.  

**\-- Can you tell me any standout moments for Airi in the movie?**  

EA: Airi almost got cut from the group in the anime series because she wasn't a good singer and dancer. While she did overcome that situation, she's still facing the same crisis in Tokyo, which leaves both of us feeling frustrated.  

But I think everyone will get to see her goodness and strength of character in this movie. Tokyo is a completely new environment for the girls and they are both excited and mesmerized at everything they see. But while they're all giddy and happy, I want everyone to keep an eye out for their darker moments as well.

**\-- Let's move on to your summer activities thus far, specifically the 2nd Live tour that kicked off in Osaka and Fukuoka. Let’s start with Osaka.**  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c004.jpg)

EA: It was a momentous start for us. We were organizing the tour in a partial capacity this time so we felt deeply involved with everyone in its creation, and we were quite nervous about how it would be received at the beginning. That's why I think everyone was so tense during the afternoon show. But we began to relax and loosen up by the night show though I think we were still tense compared to Fukuoka.  

**\-- There are a lot of new songs for this tour.**  

EA: When we talked about what we wanted for the tour this year, we wanted it to feel like an honest-to-goodness live show. I think it's possible now that we have more songs, and I'm glad that new songs were made just for this tour because we were worried that we didn't have anything else to show, which would make our shows feel repetitive and stale. Some people might go to our shows expecting that we only have _Shoujo Koukyoukyoku (SKKK)_ but they'll be surprised that we have so much more in store for them.  

**\-- Since this tour incorporated the group members' ideas in its creation, what was your contribution to it?**  

EA: I was the one who suggested that we make it a true live show experience and everyone was on-board with the idea. Unlike last year, where we had planned out variety segments, we wanted to see if we can handle a show with a full setlist. We have 5 new songs coming out, and we really want to show them off to everyone.  

**\-- You also have a lot of other ideas prepared for the shows, like prelude narrations and video introductions. Speaking of which, the narration in Osaka was voiced by you and Yoshino-san, wasn't it?**  

EA: Mayushii (Yoshioka Mayu) wrote the narration scripts for all 8 shows. I believe using character voices to build up the mood minutes before the show starts is not something other groups do much of, so I want to continue doing that as a WUG trademark. Also, keep an eye for the videos that play throughout the show, as some of them are unique for each venue.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c005.jpg)

**\-- I learned that you designed the choreography for _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_, one of the new songs for the tour. Did you have prior experience doing those?**  

EA: I used to do it with my friends back when I was studying dance, but it's my first time doing it solo. They approached me about it and I quickly said yes because it was something I wanted to try... though I immediately began to doubt myself if I could pull it off. (laughs) So I faced it as a challenge. It took about a week or two to put together and I consulted the other members along the way, since we know each other best, and it turned into a very enlightening experience.  

\[She also choreographed _Tightrope Runaway_, _Outlander Rhapsody_, _Heartline_, _Tunago_, the Hackadoll songs, and _Polaris._\]  

**\--What was the concept?**  

EA: Our choreography is known for being pretty complicated, complex, and difficult. For _Chikatetsu Labyrinth_, I wanted to show off the cute side of WUG so I thought of steps that emphasized that.  

**\-- The movements are quite cute.**  

EA: When I asked the other members for their opinion, Kaya said they were cute. I was glad to hear that because there's no doubt if she said so.  

**\-- I think being able to choreograph gives you an edge as a voice actress.**  

EA: I want to turn it into a skill that makes me unique. It’s fulfilling to hear that fans liked what I did. I was given the opportunity to choreograph for a song that we will perform together, and seeing it all come together makes me happy. I would have wanted to see it for myself too, but I can’t since I'm also dancing with them. (laughs)  

**\-- I want to ask about a particular song that was made for this tour,** **_Seventeen Crisis_****. As a unit song performed by Takagi-san, Eino-san, Yoshioka-san, Yamashita-san, and Okuno-san, can you describe the song and how it fits in the show?**  

EA: It came about from a talk we had recently about wanting to have unit songs. I like it. It's cute, upbeat and the lyrics have a different feel from our other songs. The bridge sounds like it could be a main theme for a video game. There's a lot of dancing too, which I think makes it great for a live performance.  

**\-- Since it's only sung by five members, I imagine the formations felt a little strange.**  

EA: It was much easier to balance everything compared to having seven members, which also makes it easier to choreograph! The whole experience felt new and interesting.  

**\-- I heard that you and Aoyama-san weren't able to go to Machiasobi so they ended up doing a 5-member version of Tachiagare.**  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c011.jpg)

EA: I heard about what happened there from Nanami. Miyu took over Yoppi's solo and she did a good rendition of it. I would have wanted to hear that.  

**\-- Going back to the tour, other units appeared in it as guests, namely the I-2 and I-3 club. Can tell me a little about the character you were playing as, the "Lovely Idol" Haruka Airi from the faraway Strawberry Kingdom?**  

EA: Lovely-chan’s crazy adorable. I was surprised by the reception because fans were carrying strawberry-themed items, as if they’re expecting the real Lovely-chan to show up. We were worried if playing them up as strawberries and dragon fruits might get a little too weird but, surprisingly, people like it so maybe this is something we can keep doing. By the way, I’m glad I get to call myself “Lovely-chan” but I used to have that nickname in college as well.

**\-- Really? Did you also carry yourself the same way as Lovely-chan back then?**  

EA: We're totally different! It's because of my name, Airi. Ai means “love” so they derived "Lovely" from it. It definitely wasn’t from how I looked at the time because I was an active member in a badminton club and I cut my hair short. I'll do my best to hopefully get fan mail addressed to Lovely-chan at our Sendai stop.  

\[Airi won a badminton championship in her ward when she was in junior high school.\]  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c006.jpg)

**\-- How about Kumamoto?**  

EA: I think we were more confident there compared to Osaka. We were able to truly show everyone how much we've improved.

**\-- Was Aoyama-san brimming with energy that day?**  

EA: She was more excited than usual because Fukuoka is near her hometown, and we let Yoppi take charge for this stop.  

**\-- Was that your first time in Fukuoka as well?**  

EA: Yes. It was my first time in Kyushu, even. I wondered we could perform well in unfamiliar territory but turns out it's still Japan and the food was delicious. (laughs)  

**\-- What did you get to eat?**  

EA: The day before the show we had Motsunabe (miso pot made with vegetables and pork and beef offal). I had no idea it was a popular dish in Fukuoka so I wanted to try it and it was delicious. Then after the show, the members and staff went out for Mizutaki. It was different from what I imagined. It was more of a pot dish that was full of chicken and vegetables. We also had Mentaiko (Pollack roe) and both were delicious. Hopefully, we get to go back there again!

**\-- This might be a little out of the way but can you tell me about your time in Wonder Festival (WonderFes) last month? Do you still remember your first appearance as a group back in 2014?**  

EA: I can’t even recall what exactly happened that day anymore. (laughs) I was so nervous and I really had no idea what was going on when we entered the event hall, much less what WonderFes was about. It was really awesome because I realized that it was all about anime figures. We wore uniforms that day and performed three songs, nervous the entire time. It all went by just like that and I was focusing so hard that I don’t remember anything. I might have been telling myself that it’s time to show off what I learned in the training camp.  

**\-- I'm sure the audience was excited to see who you were.**  

EA: I actually watched a video of that a while ago. It was all a blur. I wonder what was going on in my head since I was just looking down the whole time like there was a cat on my head. (laughs) Yoppi looked like she’s doing an electoral speech.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c007.jpg)

**\-- You were wearing what seemed to be winter school outfits this time, right?**  

EA: Honestly, it was so hot wearing them especially with the lights, the hall, and the energy of the crowd. (laughs)  But I think it was good that we did. SKKK is a song about the girls doing their best in Tokyo so having to perform on stage with Sendai school outfits feels poetic.  

**\-- It’s like giving the message that their hometown is always there to support them.**  

EA: Right. They’ll never forget about Sendai.  

**\-- I think your stamina also improved quite a lot compared from back then.**  

EA: It's thanks to rigorous work we did at the training camps, but also in large part to our live shows and activities along the way. We use different muscle groups in performances compared to training sessions so our bodies got more used to it. I also think we've come a long way since overcoming the physical demands of last year, including the tour.  

**\-- Lately though you're not doing cartwheels anymore in** **_7 Girls War_****.**  

EA: It's because we've switched to using hand mics for performances. We're more comfortable using them instead of headsets and I think our singing got better as a result. That said, it is a shame that I can't do them anymore.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c008.jpg)

**\-- But don’t you have a break dance solo during the intermission? That would be hard to do with a mic.**  

EA: I really want to keep doing it, but it is hard finding a good spot for it!  

\[Around this time she doesn’t actually do that part much though when she does, she hands off the mic to another member, Mayu usually.\]  

**\-- A lot of people came to your stage in WonderFes in spite of it happening first thing in the morning.**  

EA: And it's also located at the far back of the venue so I expected fewer people to show up. So I'm really grateful that a lot of people came.  

**\-- That first WonderFes showcase happened about two years after you passed the audition for Wake Up, Girls! But before all that, what aspirations did you have when you auditioned?**  

EA: I wasn't as into the idea of becoming a voice actress compared to the other members. I was simply a fan of anime and I hoped that I could somehow appear in one.  

**\-- It does take all kinds of people. I heard Yoshioka-san auditioned so she could be part of the acting world, while Yamashita-san aspired to become a vocalist.**  

EA: There's a part of me that feels the same way as Mayushii. Coming from my experience as a dancer, I also want to be on stage. But that passion died down as I entered college and... thoughts of becoming a simple office worker after graduating came creeping in.  

**\-- Reality does come crashing down on you as you get older.**  

EA: Right. But when I learned that an anime set in Sendai was going to be made, that it was going to be helmed by Director Yamamoto who did _The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya_, and that a second screening was going to be held at Sendai... I figured why not and auditioned, not really expecting anything. Then somehow from auditioning just so I could be part of an anime, no matter how small, I became a WUG member.  

\[Director Yamamoto eventually decided on her as a gut choice, in spite of her having the least acting ability out of all of the girls, likening it to Hanazawa Kana’s early career, because he wanted someone from Sendai to anchor the concept of the group to its setting.\]  

**\-- Now with that initial goal out of the way, did you have any aspirations as a voice actress before you debuted?**  

EA: I think a lot of anime fans want to try and see what it feels like to be a voice actor. I always believed it wasn't for me but I have thought about it as well. Now that I have become one and a part of WUG, I've been fortunate enough to have been part of so many activities. It lit that fire in me to be a better voice actress and be in activities to get my name and WUG’s name out there.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c012.jpg)

**\-- And that determination drove you to move to Tokyo?**  

EA: Yes. I was given this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity so I intend to make the best out of it and dedicate myself to doing the things I love.

**\-- Let me ask the same question I've asked the others. Out of all the events and live performances, has there been a time when you felt so hyped up the moment you heard the music start?**  

EA: It happened a lot of times but what stands out the most is Anisama (Animelo Summer Live). I could never forget what happened last year when we performed _Tachiagare_ and everyone shouted "Tachiagare~~!" with us. Anisama always seemed like a distant dream to me and I wanted to go to Tokyo someday and see it.  

**\-- As an anime fan and part of the audience?**  

EA: It's a dream I didn't think was possible because I lived in the countryside. So I could hardly believe it when I heard I was going there, not as a spectator, but as a performer. I was beyond happy but also deeply anxious. Thoughts like, "How many people even know about us?" and "Would people there accept us?" crossed through my mind. So I was touched when I saw that the stadium had parts of lit green, our color, as if they’re welcoming us to perform _Tachiagare_.  
  
Then being on that stage, singing, hearing Mayushii shout "Ikuzo Anisama!", and seeing everyone, thousands of people, join in and shout "Tachiagare!" blew all those anxieties away. I want to be there again in that atmosphere with everyone.  

![](/images/sp-1508152300-001-c009.jpg)

**\-- And you will be standing on the same stage once again at the end of the month \[Anisama 2015\].**  

EA: To tell you the truth, I feel terrified. It's our second time and it's a different crowd who may or may not know about us and Wake Up, Girls!. And it's always a challenge to perform on big stages like that so it's something we have to prepare for.  

**\-- I'm looking forward to your performance. By the way, you mentioned Yoshioka-san and it reminded me of something. I think she and Aoyama-san always has a strong presence on stage but I feel that you're becoming much like them now as well.**  

EA: Really? Thank you!  

**\-- You didn't notice it?**  

EA: Not at all. I think I changed a lot this year and I can also say the same last year before the tour. Thanks to all my experiences this year, I've become more comfortable speaking on stage. I still feel the jitters but somehow it’s gone once I start speaking.  

**\-- I get what you mean. All your worries just go away and your body readies itself for the performance.**  

EA: That's it. All I think about then is enjoying the moment and making sure everyone gets to have fun. I'm pretty glad that I came to that realization. (laughs)  

**\-- At the time of this interview, there are two stops left for the tour, Maihama and Sendai. Which of these to do prefer performing in?**  

EA: A lot of people go to our tour multiple times, but there are also those who can only go to one of them so I believe it’s best that we make our all shows consistently good. But I also want to show everyone how much we've improved along the way. This might sound indulgent, but my goal this year is to showcase that improvement. We were more confident at our Fukuoka show compared to Osaka and that progression won't stop in Maihama and Sendai. I want to show everyone how far we’ve come and how far we can go.  

**\-- Do you have an idea of the size of Maihama Amphitheater?**  

EA: It’s a wide venue and the audience envelops almost half the stage so they can see our formations at different angles, which I think is something worth seeing.  

**\-- That means they get to appreciate** **_Tachiagare_** **and** **_7 Girls War_** **from a different perspective especially with how well you do the formation and position changes.**  

EA: I think it’ll be interesting to watch. I think it’s only lately that I’ve gotten a real sense of space with our formations. I think it’s still best to watch it head-on because it might not look as well if you watch it from another angle. That’s why we’ll focus on making it as polished as possible.

**\-- And once again, the stop in Sendai, where WUG is set.**  

EA: Right. I’m sincerely thankful that we get do another tour stop in Sendai this year. Tokyo Electron Hall Miyagi is also quite large. I’ve been there before and it is a place usually reserved for concerts.  

**\-- What concert did you attend?**  

EA: I think it was for Morning Musume. It was so long ago. Everyone who grew up in Sendai knows how big the place is and hopes to watch a show there someday.  

**\-- Are your friends and family coming?**  

EA: They will. My mom and grandmother will be there, as well as my best friends, who I’ve known since grade school. They know about WUG and they told me they’ll come. I want to show them what makes us the best, but also it’s not Wake Up, Girls! if we didn’t have a performance in Sendai. The song _Kotonoha Aoba_, a song with Sendai as its setting, would have a different meaning if we perform it somewhere else.  

\[For Final Tour Part II, Kaya also expressed the same sentiment for putting _Kotonoho Aoba_ in the setlist with a choir, saying that it’s a song set in Tohoku and that it should be sung there.\]  

**\-- Is it because the video shows places from Sendai?**  

EA: That’s it. I sing it whenever I feel nostalgic so getting to do it in Sendai makes me happy. It’ll also make me glad if it inspired our fans to take this chance to visit Sendai and appreciate its charm.  

**\-- Finally, it sounds like the rest of the year for your group will be full of activities. Can you tell me that you’re excited about?**  

EA: With the Tour, then Anisama, _Seishun no Kage_ and another movie \[Beyond the Bottom\] in the works, this is going to be a very busy year for us. I hope to show everyone how much we’ve improved, both as a group, and myself, as we rush headlong into the next year.
