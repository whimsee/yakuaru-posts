Welcome to Translator Notes, a place where I write down random thoughts and ideas about translation. It’s going to be a lot of rambling but if you’re a translator or are interested in translating, hopefully it gives you something to relate to. And if you aren’t, I hope this gives you some inspiration or insight into how these things work from my perspective.
