The process of translation—and by extension, localization—is fascinating. In simple terms, it’s essentially writing because you put thoughts into carefully crafted words as you pull from a bunch of resources and personal experiences, filling in the gaps through research.  
  
If you’ve ever tried writing anything, you’ve pretty much experienced most of the legwork that comes with translation minus the language hurdle. Flow, word choice, nuance, research, viewpoint, audience, grammar, tense, you name it. It sounds straightforward but it’s easy to get tunnel-visioned or downright intimidated once you get into the thick of it. I certainly did when I first tried to translate something and I still do when it’s something new to me.  
  
This post will be about my translation process, specifically during the 1-year period where I just did WUG translations since it was done in pretty much the same circumstances in terms of place, amount of time, subject, format (blogs and interviews), and difficulty. That makes it easy to contextualize since it really got me to rethink and consolidate how I do translations in general.

**Location**

This might sound strange but I’ve done almost all of those translations in less than ideal settings. Sure, I do some research and finishing touches at home but most of the heavy lifting happens during my commute and secretly at my job while constantly on alert with an easy-to-hide notepad or gdocs as my trusty companions.  
  
There were also some extraordinary cases: I was at the airport when I did Miyu and Airi’s final blogs and some of the final letters, writing as much as I could hours before flying back then I spent most of my free day after getting home doing Mayu’s final blog while heavily jetlagged. I never actually translate at home unless it’s important enough (The Famitsu Interviews, which took 3 weeks each) or if it’s relevant enough that it needs to be done as soon as possible.   
  
It's stressful since I don't have much control over my time but it did keep me focused. That said, too much of a bad thing will affect quality as well so I encourage aiming for your ideal conditions. My point is that you don’t necessarily need a perfect place to translate because, much like writing, you can do it anywhere as long as you get into the right mindset and workflow.

**First Read and Dirty Draft**

I start a project with a dirty draft as I do my first read. By first read, I mean I haven’t read it at all or just partially skimmed it beforehand. By dirty, I mean incoherent word salad like this:

_Yamanaka: I remember vividly feeling (communicated directly, saw clearly) how much you loved the role (--or just the concept, loved doing it, you were into it) when you were (I saw you) recording. it made me think that the Caligula that I made (my project) had people like you as the target audience (review and rephrase). You were like an indicator/sensor/checker of how that would resonate to the Tanaka Minamis in the entire country (same people like you/soul/sensibilities, how it would resonate) (I knew right away how it would resonate to people like you across the country) (it was a sign of how much it would resonate to people just like you across the country)._  
  
\[Excerpt draft from [Yamanaka Takuya's Gamer Kouyuuroku #2: Tanaka Minami (8/24, 31/ 2019)](https://posts.yakuaru.com/Seiyuu/22.%20%5B%E7%94%B0%E4%B8%AD%E7%BE%8E%E6%B5%B7%5D%20Tanaka%20Minami.%20Yamanaka%20Takuya's%20Gamer%20Kouyuuroku%20No.%202%20(8-24,%2031-2019))\]

It’s a bunch of possible off-the-top-of-my-head phrasings coupled with random literal translations that were done with little context. Sometimes I even include interpretation notes and personal comments. If anything, it’s more stream of consciousness than actual writing. It’s a mess that I can rarely follow by the time I go through my second pass but it’s there for a reason: It’s written in English.  
  
This generally takes up the most time and I never actually use this draft aside from the occasional word, phrase, or sentence that stands out. But it is still an important step because just the act of writing it down familiarizes me with the piece and it provides a general idea of how it will go which makes the rest of the process more comfortable. It’ll tell me which sections deserve more attention, which parts benefit from having context notes, how the piece naturally sections itself, how the pacing and flow will be, the general tone and approach, overall context, among many others.  
  
Basically, I do it to lighten the mental load as much as I can and put all my spontaneous ideas out there because it’s easy to get overwhelmed and fall back to literal translations when there’s still too much to process. So I just get it out of the way, write it down in the crudest form it could ever be, and keep any happy accidents that come along the way.

**Second Read and Proper Draft**

I take a break then proceed to write a proper English draft. I essentially reread and rewrite the entire piece but since I’ve already gone over it once, it’s generally faster until I hit problem areas. For those, I normally write a more precise translation before coming back to it at a later time.

_–**YT:** I remember seeing how clearly into it you were during the recording sessions. It got me thinking that this thing I made just might be for people like you so I took it as a good sign of how well it will resonate with the “Tanaka Minami”s of the country._

This is where decision making takes place. I'd love to write a whole post just about this step alone but to keep things short: all things being equal, what shapes a translation are the decisions the translator and whoever they work with ultimately make.  
  
So many factors, personal or otherwise, come into consideration once you start thinking of it as a piece of English writing with all its rules, nuances, and quirks. Each piece requires a different approach, especially with different speakers. Words to entire paragraphs might change depending on readability and intent, both yours and the author's. It has to flow naturally and read as if the person conveyed the same ideas and emotions in English, not a Japanese approximation of English, or at least that’s what I always aim for. And this is just about interview and blog translations; you'll have to adopt a different mindset for fictional works or extremely technical stuff like instruction manuals. There’s never a right answer so I find it ideal to be flexible, pick an approach that feels right, run with it until it doesn’t work anymore then try another.  
  
On really good days or on short pieces, I can skip the dirty draft and go straight to this step but I often find myself rewriting it anyway. This is also where I start taking out the source JP text in order to declutter and mentally prepare myself for the next step. Once I’ve done that, I’ve committed to the draft. If there are any mistranslations, I’d be less likely to catch them unless it reads weird or it gets pointed out.

**Multiple reading and editing passes**

I take another break before going over it with fresh eyes. Ideally, I do this multiple times until I get sick of it. With the way Japanese translation works, you can definitely tunnel-vision and unwittingly phrase things awkwardly, run sentences too long, or just miss the point entirely because it went a different way from how you initially wrote it and have to retranslate.  
  
My advice is to read it aloud and read it again after you've forgotten what the original Japanese actually was. If it sounds like something you wouldn’t say if you’re that person in that context, you might need to go over it again. Interviews are challenging in this regard because you’re translating words from real people, often with incomplete context. You might run into situations where you have to preserve the structure or wording even if it sounds clunky because it’s more informative or because it better represents the speaker. You may also decide to completely rewrite sections while preserving the original meaning but in doing so risk misrepresenting the speaker. It’s tricky and it’s those instances where having as much knowledge as possible really helps. Blogs are simpler; find the emotional hook and lean on it with the author's voice in mind.  
  
Once I’m happy with the piece, I prepare it for publishing, go over it once again (and catch a few errors especially as the font changes), publish then read again. If I could, I’d sleep on it first before I release it to the wild. I'd like to say that's that but I still catch errors and awkward phrasings after I publish; in fact, I just did for the above except when I prepared it for this post. XD

**Research and Localization**

When in doubt, research and ask questions. Always. This is especially important for off-hand references and word usages because what works in Japanese might not in English and vice versa.  
  
_Wasei-eigo_ (Japan-made English) is one thing but as an example, in the same Minami Interview, they used the term テキストアドベンチャー \[Lit: Text adventure\] game in reference to _Fate/stay night \[Realta Nua\]_ which is a visual novel, or rather, what we English speakers expect to be as such. That makes sense in Japanese because that is a common way for them to call visual novels (or generally choice-based games that rely heavily on text) and the term “Visual novel” itself is not as widely used. I’ve even seen it referred to in another interview as ノベルゲーム \[Novel Game\].  
  
However, if you use “Text adventure game” in English, "visual novel" is not the first thing that comes to mind. You’ll more likely think of something along the lines of _Zork_, _80 Days_, maybe even classic point-and-click adventure games like _King’s Quest_. They just don’t equate well.

There are multiple ways to handle this:  
1\. Reword it to a more equivalent term. Find the appropriate term that fits the meaning and is most easily understood by your audience. Not all equivalent terms are completely accurate though so keep that in mind.  
  
2\. Make a translator note and explain from there. This is a good idea sometimes, especially when the original wording needs to be preserved. If you’re lucky, the source text will help you out and actually provide an explanation that you can use.  
  
3\. Invent a new concept. If there’s no equivalent term and compromising won’t work, create a concept and hope it makes sense. Or just keep it as it is and hope it sticks. It’s not necessarily a bad idea, sometimes that’s how more precise terminologies are coined, but consider your audience before going this route.

Those are just off the top of my head but in this case, I decided to reword it to the umbrella term “Visual novel” especially when they included _UtaPri_ into the discussion using the same term in order to stay consistent.

**Take a break**

I don't always follow this but I’ll keep hammering the point: Sleep. Take a break after reaching a milestone. Go back after you’ve rested.  
  
Translating is a mentally exhausting exercise that drains you faster than you might think. Burnout happens quick and hits hard that, in my case, even processing things in Japanese becomes impossible. And even without burnout, fatigue will result in sloppy work so always celebrate those small progress victories and take a breather.

**Mindset**

This is more philosophical but really, ask yourself why you translate and things will fall into place. That drive will get you through tough moments as well as give you direction. The WUG translations have been my way of giving back to the group. It wasn’t enough for me to appreciate them as a fan, I also wanted to communicate that appreciation to others and this was the way I knew best. It took a lot of work but if it kept their memory during their time as the group alive and maintain their momentum in some way as they proceed in their solo careers then I’m happy.  
  
That meant that my translations have to carry a sense of emotion and individuality, not just “this is what was said.” It has to show who they are as people; if they meant to sound heartfelt in Japanese, I should also carry that energy in English even if it meant the actual words won’t match as perfectly anymore. The message and emotion counts most so I translate with the hope that if they could express themselves considerably well in English, they’d probably put it that way.  
  
All that being said, this is only one of many approaches. I've [written a bit](https://posts.yakuaru.com/Translator%20Notes/Translator%20Notes.%20Emotion%20and%20Fan%20Works) about translations (usually unofficial ones) that were done with no direct link to the source being educated shots in the dark so I could be wrong altogether here as well. That would honestly suck but that's what makes translation and localization so fascinating.
