One might assume that a translation is the product of something from one language being mechanically transformed into another because, fair enough, it looks that way at first glance. When we learn a language—directly or indirectly—we immediately gravitate toward ideas such as “X phrase equates to Y because of grammar rule Z,” “X word means Y says the dictionary,” or “X figure of speech definitely means Y because culture.”

There’s nothing wrong with that per se; it’s a base to build from, especially when you’re learning. But once you start thinking of it as an interpreter or a translator and actually synthesize something from it, you quickly realize that it’s only half the battle, maybe even less. Because underneath every translation is a complex and often precarious web of biases and decisions that interact with each other and influence everything from word choice to the use of honorifics and handling of delicate subjects.

For this post, I’ll do a quick and by no means exhaustive rundown of factors that makes lines such as _yoroshiku onegaishimasu_ run the translation gamut from “please take care of me” to “thanks”, “I look forward to…”, or even “Lord bless your poor soul.” They all weigh differently depending on any number of circumstances that I won’t get into here. I can’t say for certain if they all apply to every project but they have crossed my mind at some point leading to no small amount of frustration and I have seen other translators grapple with them too that it’s worth mentioning.

**Input**  
It's what you directly work with. There’s more to it but essentially, you can't work with what you don't have.

_Source material_

It is the raw input that the translation is based on. It could be simple or complex, easy to work with or a living hell, a bunch of hiragana or a wall of kanji. It can come in a variety of formats—creative or technical—each demanding a different approach. And they all have a contextual base that you, as someone who didn’t write originally write it, might not have the full picture of. Handling even just this can have a huge impact on how a translation is shaped as you try to piece everything together.

_Author’s intent_

This means both implicit (what their work says) and explicit (what they expressly want). It needs to be taken into consideration, if not respected, no matter what. It’s their work and although one can argue that a translation is the work of a translator, and it is, it never would have been translated it in the first place without the author.  
  
It sounds simple because ideally, one should have a direct contact with the author so they can pick their brain and hopefully end up with a faithful translation but that’s not always the case. And what if the author is dead or otherwise impossible to get in touch with? What if you dislike the person or disagree with their beliefs? What if you don’t like the way they write? What if it isn’t just one person serving as the author? What if it’s already a translation or a re-imagining to begin with? Not all of these questions need answers but it does create a weird conflict when it does.

_Logistical restrictions_

It can be anything that physically limits your output. Character limits, style guides, deadlines, scope, and research material. It’s different in every case with games being notorious for the amount of technical and organizational (even artistic) challenges it needs to solve in order to get a game localized. But it is there for a reason and, for the most part, if you can find a way to push those boundaries to your advantage then it’s worth doing.

_Story demands_

Not every piece has a story but when it does, it mixes things up; it shifts how you frame the entire thing. If the setting doesn’t have a concept of God, you can’t just use “oh my God.” That wouldn’t make sense. If the way people speak changes in the source text due to some dialect or whatnot, how does that get conveyed? What about jargon and vernacular? If the story takes place in a fictional setting, does its interpretation of certain things match with the real world and how would you show that difference if there is? It’s the curveball that makes literary translation so fascinating because it can potentially lead to places that other fields can’t reach.

**Personal**  
How one decides on a handling is personal in nature. Even if everything is equal and you take out factors such as your mindset at the time or your personal health, some things really do vary from person to person.

_Writing preferences_

You’re still a writer with your own voice. Even if the words come from someone else, how it gets conveyed is shaped by your (and your editor or whoever else’s) writing ability and tendencies. Your word preferences, phrasing, composition, conciseness, sense of pace and timing, etc. has a profound influence on the text and it doesn’t have to be what’s wrong or right. Even between similarly worded sentences such as “Last night, I went to pick up my groceries,” “Yesterday evening, I went to pick up my groceries,” or “I went to pick up my groceries last night,” there’s never a consensus because everyone has a preference.

_Interpretations, impressions, and beliefs_

Have you ever read a line and immediately thought, “Wait, what? That can’t be it?” Usually, whatever it is doesn’t match with the impression you’ve been having so far and as a reader you might come out of that experience feeling anything between amazement or rage. For a translator, it carries with it a feeling of worry as doubt creeps in. What if all this time you got it wrong? What if there was a subtle yet sweet romantic tension between what you thought were completely platonic characters and you never caught it until then? What if there’s a gender or political subtext that got completely lost on you because you don’t have the experience necessary to communicate or even parse it? What if you missed the point entirely because confirmation bias influenced you to ignore it? This is where you could be absolutely wrong for being right and having different perspectives, especially that of the author, can help untangle.

_Honorifics_

For every argument for the use of honorifics there is an argument against it. How should you express the nuance of honorific verbs, desu, -san, -chan, or -kun? Do you have put them in as is to convey seniority? Should I use nicknames instead? Does it even matter?  
  
Personally, it’s part of your arsenal that can be used or discarded so it’s worth learning how to write in both styles. English does have that nuance but it needs finesse and some buildup to pull off. And if a piece needs honorifics, then there’s probably a very good reason why, often due to the demands of story or convenience, sometimes authorial or editorial intent. Either way, it’s a thing and not the end of the world if gets used or not.

_Gut feelings_

I wouldn’t really call this a factor but sometimes your intuition just knows what to do. You feel a compulsion that you can’t explain. It might even go against every decision you’ve made thus far. You might not even argue for it if it gets challenged. But things just click and you roll with it because you know deep in your heart that it’s the right thing to do. It is a risk and you should still cover your bases but it is worth listening to because those sparks of inspiration don’t come often but they sometimes make all the difference.

**Audience**  
This deserves its own section because after all that decision making, the whole point is to have it read. Who is it for? If it’s just for you then you can throw all these factors out of the window, write any way you like and end up satisfied. But once you think of a potential audience and how they would (or how you want them to) digest your piece, things start coming into focus.

For the WUG interviews, I'm aware that its primary readership are people who at least know about the group and the nuances surrounding anime song (anisong) and idol pop culture, so I could go full niche and use romaji stylings and slang and get away with it. I didn’t do that. Instead, I focused on the general reader who might be coming into them not knowing much about the subculture because if this became their way of wrapping their head around those esoteric concepts while making those pieces easier to digest in general then I’d feel better about it long-term.   
  
Sensitive topics like race and gender are tricky in this regard. You can’t necessarily change something that seems blatantly offensive or conflicting with your or your potential audience’s personal beliefs. However, you do have a measure of control over how it gets presented. When things get lost in translation, this often gets overlooked or completely overhauled because they're deeply complex topics. Having good faith helps here because things can be easily misconstrued as offensive and be left as is because “that’s what they said,” but it always worth rethinking and reconsidering if it actually makes sense in the overall context or if its portrayal of said concept is actually a criticism rather than an endorsement.  
  
An existing audience can set expectations, especially if it’s an already translated work—unofficial or otherwise—with a thriving fanbase. Everything from spellings, pronunciations, headcanon interpretations to the use of honorifics can get established before an official localization (or re-localization) happens and any change can lead to people learning multiple words for the same concept. It can be confusing and sometimes I think it is caused by some weird sense of ownership of the work but it can lead to a greater sense of consistency. One thing about ongoing works is that you never know what comes after that’ll make you rethink how a thing is presented.  
  
Lastly, when you think of the audience, who are they? The people directly engaging with the work? The ones paying for it? Hardcore fans? Mainstream? You can’t please everyone and on some level, it’s something you can’t control. But knowing the types of people who consume your work can give you an idea of how to spice it up and make it more enjoyable for them.

It looks daunting and complicated but everything is connected which actually makes things manageable and interesting in some weird way. Deciding on one factor usually influences another and it keeps going until you end up with an overall translation philosophy for that given piece. You might never be completely happy with it all the time but that’s what makes every translation unique. One translator might focus on an aspect that would result in an interpretation that another translator would have missed or couldn't lean into leading to a perspective that benefits everyone. That’s why I’m all for re-translations if it’s worth doing (which is another topic entirely) because the web of decision-making that makes a translation leads to all sorts of possibilities.
