Welcome! 

This is an archive of https://whimsicaltranslations.wordpress.com as I've finally decided to migrate from the platform.

Here you'll find the same 'ol seiyuu interviews, *Wake Up, Girls!* content, translation musings, and the odd guide or two. I love to write about things that interest me so I may add more if I find something neat to write about!

Feel free to check out https://links.yakuaru.com for my other resources. Thanks for stopping by!
